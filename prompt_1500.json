    "text": "This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare wrote many a sonnet\nAbout maids who abandoned the bonnet;\nTresses tossed in the breeze\nMade him weak at the knees\nWith the urge, and the acting upon it.\n\nIf you live off the land, life is cruel\nIn the southwest U.S., but a jewel\nOf a plant, I'm assured,\nIs the buffalo gourd,\nAs its seeds yield an oil good for fuel.\n\nPosition your cursor and click:\nVoila! There are items to pick.\nIt's a down-dropping menu\u2014\nIn 2010, you\nShould know this already, you hick!\n\nDear fans, re the letters you write:\nPeace and love, but I'm losing the fight.\nFrom October, I'm sure,\nThey'll be answered no more:\nI've no time. Peace and love, and goodnight.\n\nThe apron is not where they race,\nNor the spot with repairs taking place.\nOn a racetrack it's seen\nAs what's found in between,\nAn important transitional space.\n\nI accept this is not quite the norm;\nI don't care if it's cold or it's warm.\nIn one state you can't seize me;\nAllotropy frees me\nTo be in far more than one form.\n\nOur pastor says I've a subliminal\nUnconscious desire to be criminal,\nSo I pray night and day\nTo keep Satan away\nAnd I bray out the hymns from our hymn-i-nal.\n\nThey are anthropophilic: they eat\nAny people they happen to meet.\nWe're not all that they chew;\nThey'll eat other things, too,\nBut think we are the tastiest treat.\n\n\"Since the first day I saw you,\" said he,\n\"You're just lovely\u2014so clever, so free!\"\nBut I (thanks to mother)\nKnew one line from another.\n\"That banana oil won't work on me!\"\n\n\"So, what is a fly loft,\" you say?\n\"A loft where freed flies fly away?\"\n\"No, it's just what one calls\nThe high grid-bearing walls\nHolding backdrops and props in a play.\"\n\nDisencumbrance: an obsolete word\nWhich folks may have seen, but not heard.\nIt describes the removal\n(And not the approval)\nOf burdensome stuff. Not absurd.\n\nDear folks,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm feeling rah-rahsome,\nA bouquet just to say that you're awesome.\nYou remind me (wrote Alix)\nOf a flower's green calyx:\nYou sheltered the bud, brace the blossom.\n\nWe all long to belong, so do you\nHave a fam'ly, a country? A clue:\nWhat will hold all together\nIs dependent on whether\nYou've got ties to the others\u2014love's glue.\n\nMake this lens and you'll not only pass,\nYou will rise to the top of the class.\nIt must never diffuse\nLong-wave reds from short blues.\nHint: You might want to check out crown glass.\n\nThis occurs when our government tries\nTo dress facts in deceptive disguise:\nA credibility gap\nMeans they're feeding us crap,\nAnd the truth is, we're sick of those lies.\n\nThe asp was evicted for pissin'\nAll over his place.  He said, \"Listen,\nI'm just a poor snake\nWho cannot catch a break\u2014\nNot even a small pit to hiss in.\"\n\nWithout enough water to drink,\nWe soon find it harder to think,\nAs our brains shrivel up.\nSo let's guzzle each cup,\nLest our cortices rapidly shrink.\n\nI just learned this new fact. I'll expound:\nTurns out ground water's never been ground\nLike with coffee or beef.\nIt is really, in brief,\nNormal water in aquifers found.\n\nFor herbivorous beasts called gelada,\nEthiopia's home, not Nevada.\nThese are monkeys \u2014 robust,\nWith a rock-climbing lust.\nAnd you've not seen one yet? You've just gotta.\n\nPaper dolls are quite easy, you know.\nFold the paper, then cut. Just go slow.\nAny amateur who\nHas some scissors will do.\nCutting diamonds, of course, takes a pro.\n\nPlease forgive me, for I do not know\nHow to say the name Vincent van Gogh.\nDoes the name rhyme with cough,\nThat elusive van Gogh,\nOr with block? Give your answer below.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nThe arachnid sits down right beside her\nIn hopes she'll allow him to guide her.\nWill this slick cobweb weaver\nSeduce and deceive her?\nWho knows? He's a comb-footed spider!\n\nWhen my chemist approached me, I laughed\nAs he offered an ominous draught.\nWith this apozem nigh,\nHe enjoined me to try\nA decoction decidedly daft.\n\n\"A dichloride is sometimes a salt.\nIt has two chlorine atoms,\" said Walt,\n\"And it may be organic,\nOr not; but don't panic.\nFor the differences, Nature's at fault.\"\n\nIs this structure a fence or a wall?\nBoth are flat, both divide, both are tall.\nLook far down, Buttercup,\nAt what holds the thing up.\nFor a fence, no foundation at all.\n\nOn occasion they'll charge a small fee,\nBut quite often a day pass is free.\nAt a brewer's guest hall\nWithout cost, quaff it all.\n(Moderation should govern the spree.)\n\n\"'Ere, Nobby, just 'and me the gear,\"\nSays Pilfering Sid in me ear,\nSo I gives 'im the cutters,\nAn' now the bloke mutters,\n\"This bolt is 'ard work\u2026 somefink's queer.\"\n\nDid it equalize odds, make things even?\n No, your Colt didn't help, and you're leavin'\n This earth 'cause he drew\nHis Colt faster than you.\n Your slow draw means your widow's a-grievin'.\n\nOh, don't throw your toys out your pram!\nYes, I treat all your emails as spam.\nHurt your feelings? Don't care;\nI don't like you, so there!\nJust accept that I don't give a damn!\n\nMy goal is to balance my budget.\nIt's hard, but I don't much begrudge it:\nNo butter for bread;\nIt's marg'rine instead.\n(While shopping at Nordstroms, I fudge it!)\n\nA corf, full of coal, sees the light\nAs it's hauled up the shaft the full height.\nYet my time I consign\nWorkin' down in the mine,\nDeep below, where it's darker than night.\n\n\"Your mom's an exceptor,\" screamed Heather,\n\"Objecting to me! She's your tether!\nOur wedding, let's skip!\nYou're attached at her hip!\nI just know you'll be happy together!\"\n\nJulie Andrews says fa is a long\nWay to run, as she teaches in song.\nIt is post do, re, mi\nAnd precedes so, la, ti;\nBut these notes, all off-key, I sing wrong.\n\nCircular polarization:\nA helix-shaped light wave formation\nThat travels through space\n(Any time, any place)\nTo the Earth from the dawn of creation.",
