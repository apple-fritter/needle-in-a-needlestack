# Purpose of this directory
The purpose of this directory is to store full prompts that were used for each test.

## Structure
There is a directory for every test.  The name of the directory is the date and time plus the model used. The files in
the directory are named based on the question number, question_location and cycle number. 
Ex: question 0, location 7 and cycle 3 would be named `0_7_3.txt`.
