This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.



Whilst Adam was praying in chapel,
Young Eve popped around with an apple.
"Dear," she said, "take a bite!"
Which he did, with delight;
Now with knowledge of evil they grapple.

Our membership's starting to droop,
And our losses we need to recoup.
To revitalize things
With the spirit that brings,
Let's recruit some fresh blood to our group.

It sells playthings of marvelous sorts
And equipment for little kids' sports.
It's a landmark; what's more,
It's my favorite store—
The cool toyshop called FAO Schwarz.

Our most serious faces we don
As the blamestorming session goes on.
Someone died. Who's to blame?
The one person we name
Is a janitor's helper named Juan.

If you're craving a snack with some zing,
Grab a zesty, fried Buffalo wing.
Lay the bleu cheese on thick;
Add a celery stick.
It's a munchie that's fit for a king.

If you use a medicinal tampon,
Just which is the part it will clamp on?
Later, if you feel pain
That makes you complain,
Is it men that you blame the worst cramp on?

A caudex, as botanists learn,
Is the stem of a palm or a fern,
Or the tangled wood base
Of a plant I embrace—
The perennial, oft to return.

The Emperor, as everyone knows,
Ends orations with terminal prose.
Where he once waxed devout,
He now hollers, "Peace out!"
We call it the Emperor's new close.

Dump the masks. This new "flu", it'll pass.
Drink some bleach on the beach. Quaff a glass.
Ignore  Fauci and Birx—
That drug chlorophine works.
One more thing—shine UV up your ass.

I'm a green-hearted arbitrage planner,
Taking cans from Fort Wayne, Indiana,
To Detroit, where they each
Yield a dime — what a peach! —
Which explains my insouciant manner.

When you're causing a liquid to flow
Through a porous material, so
Induced by applying
A current, you're trying
Electro-osmosis you know.

As you wait, please take note of the comma:
Though too short for the pearl-diving ama,
In a series, in clauses,
Wherever it pauses,
It modifies, keeping down drama.

The adverb's a versatile guy:
It modifies verbs, low and high,
And all adjectives too;
Then it adds to the brew
Words like also, how, when, where, and why.

What's a fundus (from Latin for bottom)?
Well, some hollow organs have got 'em —
Have fundi, that is.
See, the bladder (gee whiz)
Has just one, while the brain has a lot. Um,

The brain's many fundi are wee,
One in each tiny groove that you see
At dissection. The other,
Be you kid, dad or mother,
Is across from the hole for your pee.

She hails from across the Pacific,
And her methods are quite scientific.
As a baker? Terrific!
Her output's prolific;
Her breads are all crisp and crustific.

In the lab, they looked far and looked wide
For this peptide! Oh my, how they tried!
They were all in a bind;
Their research could not find
AASH.  It wounded their pride.

The word bed is a term that appeals
To those folks who like bivalve-y meals.
It means groups of, you know,
Clams and oysters, although
It can also denote snakes or eels.

He's a blogger, an Internet bore
With unwanted opinions galore.
Once you've read what he thinks,
You'll find dozens more links
In his blogroll. Feel free to explore!

In Beslan, the terrorist shows
The depths to which wickedness goes,
Having goons in his squad
Killing children—for God?
Damn this scum to perpetual throes!

I am easing down into the pool
Just a step at a time (it's too cool).
They're complaining that I'm
Taking way too much time,
As if leaping in's some kind of rule.

He was typical TV news fare:
Perfect teeth, perfect clothes, perfect hair.
But the things that he said?
He's a damn barking head!
He's aggressive, abusive, unfair.

The bunchberry creeps near a wall;
It's an herb, only three inches tall.
This perennial plant
Is a dogwood that can't
Stand erect, so it chooses to crawl.

Says an actress of fading mystique:
"I despise this new camera technique!
Deep focus draws eyes
To the background," she sighs,
"And away from my famous physique."

U.S. women aren't flat-chested. See,
They're full-bodied, not A and not B.
From Denver to Dover,
Their cups runneth over—
Average bra: 34 Double-D.

Poems are joys; you recite and repeat 'em,
But, while lovely, one thing sure can beat 'em:
Trees, as Kilmer conceived,
And good dryads believed.
Check that out at the right arboretum.

Alabama's a tolerant state:
Most inhabitants harbor no hate
For outsiders and blacks,
As today they relax
In communities, locking the gate.

Fetoproteins, unseen since the womb,
When they surge late in life, may spell doom.
If they're alpha, the answer
May be liver cancer —
More tests may yet save you from gloom.

Oh, don't throw your toys out your pram!
Yes, I treat all your emails as spam.
Hurt your feelings? Don't care;
I don't like you, so there!
Just accept that I don't give a damn!

That decitizenized rat's a state traitor.
Those people who loved her now hate 'er.
Of her country bereft,
Her homeland she's left —
Glad it happened right now, and not later.

To the day that they knock on death's door,
All the rich receive blessings galore:
Massive homes, fancy cars,
Ten-inch Cuban cigars,
But the poor just get kids, nothing more.

Said a wealthy young man from Bohemia,
"You'll stay poor if you choose academia.
My success—I've no debts—
With invertebrate pets
Is with sea monkeys, genus Artemia."

At the peak of Mount Burton it's breezy.
Some say gaining that point makes one queasy.
Climbers claim for this test
That the north face is best,
But I just took the ski lift. It's easy!

"This mixed-up, disorderly bar,"
I declare, "is my favorite by far!"
Adds a Bronxite, disjointly,
Not quite to-the-point-ly:
"Dis joint's an exploding cigar!"

 

Why do I treat all your emails as spam?
