Watching Beautiful Her climb the hill
From his vantage, he gets a cheap thrill.
That's not real satisfaction.
He's plagued by inaction:
Not tried for a date, never will.

Some say astronavigation is fun.
First you start with a "sight" from the sun.
Next you do it again
With the moon, maybe.  Then
Plot the pair, find a match, and you're done.

With a blade, mark your name into ice;
It will melt into water, each slice.
Carve your name into stone;
It will stay there, alone,
For a long geological trice.

"I would bet my best horse and gold ring
That soon we will follow our king
Into France," said Prince John.
"It is nearly foregone.
How'd I learn that? I heard a bird sing."

Advertisement conveyancer? Me?
You say that's what I'm destined to be?
As a sandwich board man
I would be, by your plan,
Nothing more than a walking marquee!

A spring, wedge or weight for your door
Is a doorstop.  But wait, there is more:
A sandwich that's thick,
A PC (old and sick),
An MP sticking in his great oar.

Said Hadrian, "Legions will cheer
When they see the research I have here.
This large cohort study
Has proved to me, buddy,
That soldiers fight better on beer."

Every day when I want to fly free,
I employ this device: AAD.
If the stuff hits the fan,
It's my anti-splat plan —
It deploys the reserve chute for me.

Though the lady's offensive and coarse,
With the face of an ill-tempered horse,
The size of her dower
Caused passion to flower
(But it couldn't prevent the divorce).

When they named him "Sure Thing to Succeed,"
He esteemed it an honor, indeed.
Up on stage, after dinner,
They'd called him a winner,
And, bursting with pride, he had peed.

If described as dysgenic, it means
You have negative traits in your genes;
Whilst the positive kind,
As eugenic defined,
Are improving of man's social scenes.

His sister ruled Thebes—Queen Jocasta,
But Creon was also a master.
When his sister had sex
With her son, Eddie Rex,
Creon soon made the best of disaster.

Angry people are known to appall;
Full of bile, they've no humor at all.
For the French, it's no mystery:
Nowhere was history
Ever more bitter than Gaul.

When a Briton says awlbird to you,
Then their dialect's rural ('tis true).
Well, a woodpecker (green)
May well be what they've seen;
Or an avocet, just wading through.

Clinton beat the Obama sensation —
In New Hampshire at least.  Vindication?
Had more states followed suit,
There'd have been no dispute.
She'd have picked up her crown (coronation).

I've a biosynthetic balloon;
At night it shines bright as the moon,
For it's made of pure silk,
Which is white as iced milk
(But is still just some insect's cocoon).

At a cookout, you'd want a potato
With beefsteak, and also a plate o'
Delicious baked beans,
Fluffy biscuits, some greens,
And a nice juicy beefsteak tomato.

Consultants, who haven't a clue,
Earn by counselling others who do.
Why not get with the cult and see
How a consultancy
Makes lots of money for you?

I'm a cinemagoer no more.
First, to get to the theater's a chore,
Plus the people are rude,
I can't watch in the nude,
And most movies today are a snore.

My lawyer just called on the phone,
And he's summoning me to depone
With my husband. We both
Will be grilled, under oath.
Well, I'd hate to depone all alone!

My photovoltaic array—
Hip hooray!—started working today.
It's tied into the grid.
When the sun isn't hid,
I'm collecting my F.I.T. pay.

The word dogtrick—its sound can evoke
Something sneaky, a practical joke,
One that's nasty and churlish
(Not cute, sweet, or girlish).
It's more of a poke than a stroke.

When a value's an outlier datum,
You've statistical reasons to hate 'im.
Should you keep 'im or not?
'E would screw up your plot.
Toss 'im out.  Claim your dog went 'n' ate 'im.

On the beach she sees constant reminders
Of features more fair than I'd find hers.
So she says, "Hold your horses!"
Her recourse, of course, is
To outfit my eyes with some blinders.

My declinature of my election
Was made after honest reflection.
While I once was a Red,
I'm White Army, instead —
So just chalk this one up to defection.

'Twas quite late when Suzanne had awoken.
At the bus stop she reached for a token.
What a terrible day!
She had no way to pay;
She was broke, 'cause her purse clasp had broken.

In our serum, the fat-bearing fraction,
The product of gut chylifaction,
Is formed in digestion.
This is, without question,
A most beneficial reaction.

"Let us gamble," said he, with a smile,
"On the toss of a coin: cross and pile!"
When he won every toss,
It was I that was cross;
My whole pile had been lost to his guile!

"Have you heard of the famed Cristofori?
What a genius he was! That Signor, he
Invented the for-
tepiano, purpor-
tedly." "Sì, that's indeed a true story."

Alfalfa sprouts taste just like grass,
Yet vegan folks think they're first-class.
A nice little crunch
To add to your lunch —
A healthy, spaghetti-like mass.

In his barracan jacket and hat,
The old gentleman lounged on his mat.
In this heat? How absurd!
Before long the man stirred.
I've learned much from that old desert rat.

Free association?  It seems so insane
To blurt out what comes into my brain —
An ad-libbed verbal stream
As if out of a dream:
Milk of kindness, Swiss cheese, rain in Spain.

Out of luck, out of work, made a choice:
Hung his shingle out, gave himself voice.
Now he's called a consultant
With high fees resultant
To go with his leased, used Rolls Royce.

A boardman belongs to the board
Of a firm, such as Boeing or Jord.
His chairman presides
And, at times, overrides
His plans, which the firm can't afford.

If your toes always itch at a meet,
Use a remedy—neat and discreet.
Clioquinol's the stuff,
If you use it enough,
That ensures you have sweet athlete's feet.

Hurry up and start moving your ass
A lot faster.  Don't give me no sass.
(You could speed up our take-off
By taking the brake off.)
Get the lead out.  Yo!  Step on the gas!

As the jungle Olympics begin,
There's a cat not expecting chagrin
'Cause she's never been beat.
But the winner will cheat
And, unfairly, this cheetah won't win.

The penalty now? Durance vile!
They torture him, too, all the while!
In a prison he sits,
Just for loosing some bits
Of memos in Wikileaks style.

Buy Baltic, an Avenue small,
For the masses with no cash at all.
It's a shoddy faex populi,
Not Boardwalk Monopoly,
But still sways the game, I recall.

Your eau de cologne is the best—
Its attractancy leaves 'em obsessed.
It's especially great
At seducing a mate
When you wear it while scantily dressed.

In their dry desert city, Dubai,
They've built towers that reach for the sky.
Midst hot sands, you can ski
Without hitting a tree
And get frostbite, while locals? They fry.

The Food Police say it is folly
To gorge on the stuff we deem jolly.
Each day we must eat
Veggie servings, like beet,
Carrots, cantaloupe, cabbage and cauli.

My gawky (so graceless) great auk
Has an awkward and wag-waddle walk.
He can't fly, since his wings
Are just stubby, small things,
But that garefowl sure swims! (Hear him squawk.)

My tabby meowed at me, doleful,
Because I denied her a bowlful
Of pussycat treats.
It's one of her feats
To give me a look that is soulful.

Ol' Grandpa avoided much strife
By steering folks' praise to his wife,
Disavowing all credit,
With a smile as he said it,
Aw-shucksing his way through his life.

All my kids run about, and they shout.
Try correcting? They whimper and pout.
So from morning till night
It's a daylong fight—quite—
An encounter, day in and day out.

Bracket fungus: a shelf-like formation
That's found in a deep woods location
More often than not,
Though its name sounds a lot
Like some crap that attacks punctuation.

Aspidistra, with leaves green and crisp,
Is hardy—no will-o'-the-wisp.
It will thrive, even bloom,
In a dark, gloomy room.
(It's a job to pronounce with a lisp.)

She was eagerness—quick to excite;
Now there's iciness, stiff and polite.
Have I come on too strong?
Where's her heat? What's gone wrong?
Driven off by the cool of the night.

The term boorishness never agrees
With one who says "Thank you" and "Please".
But to one who is rude
And uncouth and quite crude,
It applies with the greatest of ease.

There's a story that's certain to please,
Drenched in sun, often tossed in the breeze.
Though over already,
Its heights are quite heady:
Emergents, the tallest of trees.

Got a problem that won't go away?
Is that why you're starting to fray?
Well, quit fussing about:
Kick that bugaboo out—
Your new life is beginning today!

Connecticut-born limerick writer,
He's more of a lover than fighter.
Relates to agnostics,
In love with acrostics,
Seeks Pam but prefers someone brighter.

To remove all the scum and the grub
From your beautiful porcelain tub,
Use a cleanser and sponge
To apply to that grunge,
And then rub-a-dub-dub as you scrub.

Can the ages make stone out of wood?
And that change — is it bad? Is it good?
What might prove that it's possible
For trees to be fossible?
A dendrolite certainly could.

He's a Chippendale, rugged and young,
Who, I hear, has a versatile tongue.
He makes passions emerge,
This barbarian scourge.
I'm in lust for Attila the Hung.

Ahmadinejad's building a nuke,
And the world gives its strongest rebuke.
Yet Mahmoud doesn't care:
"No, not me!" he'll declare.
He's a liar, a fraud, and a kook.

I'll have to admit a proclivity
For occasional slight creativity
In the writing of verse:
I could surely do worse
In my choice of a pointless activity.

The dissonance grates on the ear;
It's horribly painful to hear —
The music's so awful
It's almost unlawful!
This man has no talent, I fear.

Right in front of his class he'd present 'em
Conservation of mass and momentum
As the laws they would need
To determine the speed
Of the jet that Bill Lear once had lent him.

A grocer's apprentice sinned thrice,
With loose women, wild drinking and dice.
When his pay was run through
He put thievery too
On the list of ill-doing and vice.

Arbitration: we seek to arrange,
For our deal, the best rate of exchange.
Pay in dollars or pounds?
Or in euros? It sounds
As if currency's fluid, how strange!

The Cold War, this old statesman pulled off;
You might laud what he did, you might scoff.
That was John Foster Dulles,
Whose name rhymes with cullis:
A gutter, a sluice, or a trough.

Dehumanization? Insanity!
It's not just a blow to one's vanity.
If one's forced to conform,
Made to follow the norm,
It deprives one of basic humanity.

A colonial general, George,
Having camped on the edge of a gorge,
Took a bit of a spill
When he couldn't lie still
Once abed with one Valerie Forge.

With a fault plane, a fracture or crack
In our planet Earth's strata may track
For long distances and,
If disturbed, it may land
Us with earthquakes, alas and alack.

To our veteran ducks be a pal.
If they're down, try to boost their morale,
For they've been through the gore
Of the Second World War,
Serving bravely on Waddle Canal.

"So tomorrow we knock off the creep,
And I promise that no one will weep.
With a big day ahead
You should all go to bed.
Can the chat. Douse the lights. Go to sleep."

My boyfriend would never disparage
Tradition when proffering marriage,
But it seemed rather louche
That he came by barouche
(That's a horse-drawn antique four-wheeled carriage).

What dentist can ever compete
With Doc Sweet, who loves words obsolete?
When he pulled out my tooth,
He informed me, "In sooth,
Your premolar I had to extreat."

What's the Chatham House Rule? I declare:
Information you're welcome to share,
But you hereby disclaim
Any mention of name
Or alliance, and so on, elsewhere.

Though it seems a batologist might
Study mammals that fly in the night,
Prickly shrubs are his focus,
Those brambles that poke us.
Being stuck in the job is his plight.

Where do Louis and Marvin abide
In adjacent graves (laid side by side)?
Just where can you see
Plots for big Joe and Lee?
From DC it is just a short ride.

Aonian references muses,
Those creatures a poet abuses.
When one fails to see
What the next word might be,
The muses are lovely excuses.

'Twas a breach of good manners to broach
The inheritance; that would encroach
On the process of mourning;
She was given fair warning,
But her greed overrode all reproach.

A lightweight and short-barreled gun
Was the carbine—a specialized one
For the cavalry men
Riding horses back when
It was awkward to shoot on the run.

My memory's short. I'm a fish.
Just to swim and find food is my wish.
I forget — was I taught
To avoid getting caught?
Oh, my memory's short; I'm a ... hmm.

My phone's call history showed that I had
Not been talking that night to my dad,
Who was not at all thrilled
That our neighbour'd been killed,
So my alibi's blown—just too bad!

The explorer barged in most audaciously,
As some cannibals dined very graciously.
Then he beat a retreat
So he wouldn't be meat
For a tribe who might eat him voraciously.

The cat daddy dance will compel
You to act like a fool for a spell.
Though this may make you chuckle,
A seatbelt you buckle
And you roll in a wheelchair as well.

Adam's home, very soon to deploy
To Iraq's Sadr City; this boy
Came to say his goodbyes,
Hoping nobody cries,
Wearing boldness one sob could destroy.

A chatroom's a site that will let
Users talk, in real time, on the Net.
Type a message, hit "Send"—
You can make a new friend.
Heck, it's how your dear wife and I met!

A randy old sloth up a tree
Met an ai from Shanghai, and when he
Got a look at her heinie—
He whispered, "Wo ai ni!"
And two three-toed sloths became three.

Abjudication—judicial rejection—
Should rest upon just circumspection.
But the judge who decided
That my claim's misguided
Will pay, should he seek re-election.

A city on high's the Acropolis;
It stands far above the metropolis.
Here temples abound
Upon Greek sacred ground,
And the gods are the principal populace.

With certainty, dollars to donuts,
For my chocolate confections you'll go nuts.
Come on in.  Get your haul
Of two kinds that I call
Male and female—the latter has no nuts.

Lovely, low-growing shrub from Australia,
The Coral Gem's not an azalea—
Grevillea's the genus—
And strictly between us,
For flowers, it outshines the Vidalia.

Breaks my heart how he's fallen; it's humbling:
Recent work seems distracted and fumbling.
His latest raw copy?
Disjointed and choppy.
Our publishing house may be crumbling.

My classmate and I went to sea.
As a shipmate I knew he would be
Not a very brave guy—
But then neither am I—
In the casemate we hide, him and me.

The grains are well sorted and rounded.
Into cross-beds and ripples they're mounded.
Quartz arenite formed
Where the sand was once warmed:
On a beach, turned to stone, waves once pounded.

We talk of the price that we've paid
With the value in dollars displayed.
No accounting of cost
Can list all that is lost—
The costliness cannot be weighed.

"I'm a D.D.S. kind of a gal!"
Well, I needed some work (root canal).
For the next time, will I
Be the kind of a guy
Who makes sure she's a dentist? I shall!

Here's to Trixie, the new hire from Dixie—
Energetic, incessantly fixy.
Tiny flaws she detects
She detests, then corrects.
We indulge her. She's cute as a pixie.

They travel in hordes, not in pairs.
They're common, without snooty airs.
Like their tropical cousins,
They bite by the dozens.
Do bedbugs get jet lag? Who cares!

My friend Ben, flipping coins, turned up ten
POTUS heads in a row.  I cried, "Ben,
I'll bet all next on tails —
There's no way that bet fails!"
Gambler's fallacy, though, struck again.

Abracadabra's a phrase
Of magicians, although in past days
It was thought to aid healing
When worn while ill feeling.
The necklace would cure your malaise.

Edmund Trebus found fame on TV.
A compulsive collector was he.
His home was quite packed
With old junk, which was stacked
In his garden as well. No space free!

Pick an element. Do some exploring.
Try adding some bromine while pouring.
If you mix them as stated,
A compound's created.
You've just made a bromide.  That's boring.

She gazed at me hotly, boudoirally,
Bosom heaving and eyes glowing starrily.
In spite of my virus
She made me desirous.
"Led's ged barried," I offered, catarrhally.

Cubic functions, I'm learning, would be
Polynomials where three's the degree.
My study confirms
They're the sum of four terms:
ax³, bx², cx, d.

To flyte is to wrangle, to scold.
And flytings? Abuse: uncontrolled
Or poetical slagging fights
Purely for bragging rights —
Slander, when rhymed, good as gold.

You don't wish to complete what's been started?
Choose French leave, don't act soft and half-hearted.
Best be firm and abrupt
When farewells may disrupt.
Just take off: join the wisely departed.

Vile villainy makes Roger gleeful,
He's "MWA-ha-ha-HA! Glory be!"-ful.
He's not striving to claim
Some nefarious aim—
He's exuberant just being eeful.

Jane complained in a voice most melodious:
"I declare, this old car's discommodious;
It is most inconvenient!
I try to be lenient,
But the seats are so lumpy it's odious."

When my friend, at the end of his tether
With delusions, required to know whether
He might be a curtain,
His shrink said, "Not certain—
Try pulling yourself back together!"

The petite calamondin's a tree
And a fruit that's as tart as can be.
It's a bit like a lime
And an orange, so I'm
Gonna try it today in my tea.

Anatomically speaking, expect
To find structures that interconnect.
If you guess one's a cord,
There's no special award,
'Cause it looks like a rope, last I checked.

Paroxysmal anginiform pain
Is spasmodic—it's hard to explain—
Where you feel suffocation,
And a choking sensation.
One cause? Myocardial strain.

Once a mace meant a stick, used to hit
One's opponents—which now seems unfit.
Now they hit in your face
With a chemical mace;
A smash hit of a name, I admit.

When I planned my vacation to ski,
My thermometer read 23,
But the slope where I go
Wasn't covered by snow,
Since the temperature scale was in C.

When a cricket gets into your house
It will make much more noise than a mouse.
It's obnoxious at best;
This orthopterous pest
Is a wing-rubbing, sleep-robbing chouse.

Mr. Thistle, what's this all about?
All our rules you dismiss — baldly flout.
I have read your epistle;
It made my hairs bristle.
I'm blowing the whistle — you're out!

Said her hubby, in love with her madly,
"I want to make love to you badly!"
Said she, "Have no fear,
You've succeeded, my dear,"
While recalling their lovemaking, sadly.

A jocular surgeon named Jones
Made puns that elicited groans.
His skill? Orthopedic.
His patter? Comedic—
They laughed while he set fractured bones.

He's a follower; never a leader.
If you threaten what's his, he's a ceder
(Not a cedar, the tree,
But a coward). Says he,
"Please don't hit me—I think I'm a bleeder!"

It's in fantasyland you reside.
You imagine that gal by your side.
Sorry, bud.  In your dreams.
She won't go to extremes
And date dorks.  She's too cool for that ride.

To this genus of germ—Escherichia:
By mistake I, last week, took a lick o' ya.
Now my gut's tied in knots
And I've bowel movements—lots.
Just begone from my paunch, bug. I'm sick o' ya!

Alex Colville, an artist in paint,
Rendered passion with careful constraint.
He achieved wide acclaim
Dot by dot, made his name
With rare paintings suggestive of plaint.

Da Vinci, that wonderful fella,
Couldn't always produce a top sella.
As a genius, he's hailed,
Yet he frequently failed—
Ever try his spaghetti umbrella?

Finding shells of the brachiopod
On the top of a mountain seems odd.
Such a fossil find shows
That the ocean floor rose;
Plate tectonics, they say, gets the nod.

Among great kings and queens you're the ace,
Mighty emperor, seated in grace.
Holy Rome's your domain;
You reign also in Spain.
I beg leave to ask: Why the long face?

I'm on Facebook by day and by night.
My followers like what I write.
I've got invites and friends.
I've got feeds to the trends.
But have I got a life? No, not quite.

At birthdays, with grim regularity,
I'm careful to show gender parity,
Presenting gold pieces
To nephews and nieces
With genial avuncularity.

A drawhead's the flanged outer end
Of a drawbar; the term can extend
To the drawgear in full,
Which allows you to pull
The next car in the train that you tend.

Dimetric: the shape of a stone,
How its crystalline structure is known.
The concept embraces
Quadrangular faces
Where two equal axes have grown.

Alliances wont to pursue
Male opponents to claim and subdue
All their females and scions
Are groups of young lions —
Coalitions the bravest eschew.

All the posters shrieked, "WORLD'S GREATEST FAIR:
Be boring, be dead or be there!"
But when we arrived
Our raised hopes quickly dived:
Muddy field, a damp squib, and thin air!

I know where the black phoebe stays,
Where the mockingbird's found on most days.
White-crowned sparrows will hide
In my shrub, deep inside,
When the bird-eating sharp-shinned hawk preys.

As our quarrels grew fraught and then fraughter
And we both were half-minded for slaughter,
My double-X issue
Exclaimed, through her tissue,
"Oh, Mom — weren't you ever a daughter?"

"He's a foreigner—right?—from afar,
Clad in clothing outlandish, bizarre.
Was he born in Bombay?
Mandalay?" "San Jose!"
"Hell, I thought him a czar from Dakar."

To my bride, young, attractive and svelte,
I confessed I'd got under my belt
Seven lovers, "And you?"
She replied, "82."
That was more than sufficient, I felt.

Just lately I'm not feeling great;
I'm condemned to be working here late.
But that's how life goes
As the list slowly grows
Of your limericks awaiting their fate.

This true bug is a sucker (not biter),
And, on cereal grasses, a blighter.
Bishop's mitre's  its name
And its main claim to fame.
Did its shape prompt that moniker? Mitre.

If two different dyes have been blended
But you'd like them apart, as intended,
Chromatography's key:
Find a medium free
To choose one from the other.  It's mended.

When you dress, since it's clear you're a fox,
You delight in the sheerest of frocks.
But you're going to play
Some strip poker today,
So you add to this nine pair of socks.

In a frenzied attack the man fell.
His assailant was clearly unwell:
Her violence was manic
And frantic. In panic,
She raged like a creature from hell.

This oddly named band was, no joke,
Bubble Puppy; they hit with "Hot Smoke
& Sassafras," seen
On the charts at 14;
But no more in the limelight they'd soak.

"What a cool, lovely day!" proclaimed Dot.
"In this breeze, I may freeze on the spot!"
I said, trying to please.
Was she being a tease?
It was ninety degrees—downright hot!

"My religion is truer than yours."
"I'm more faithful, I'd die for my cause."
They're very unpleasant,
The Cross and the Crescent.
Belief — the begetter of wars.

The facets you've ground can collapse
At the smallest of innocent taps.
A cabochon's assets?
The gem has no facets —
Or an infinite number, perhaps.

She's a casual, passing on through,
In her backpack's a trick… maybe two.
She won't pause here to spawn.
Before long, she'll move on.
Have your fun, son; you're long overdue.

Ecce Homo paints Jesus, alive,
Crowned with thorns. Here we see someone strive
To depict, in true fashion,
The pain of Christ's passion.
Behold the man (John 19:5).

Dragged my pen 'cross the paper. No prank,
Made a line that was straight as a plank.
Said my friend, "What's it show?
Just what is it?" "Don't know,
I'm afraid I'm just drawing a blank."

Will the war in Iraq ever cease?
Or will terror and bloodshed increase?
We must never ignore
That in decades before
There was Baghdad, the "City of Peace."

I expurgate content too raw,
Like a pup in a crocodile's maw.
I redact the indecent;
The worst of the recent
Involved what a pedophile saw.

"Oh my darling, I love you," he sighed.
"I shall leave her one day," but he lied.
When at last she saw sense,
His relief was immense—
She was only his bit on the side.

His lectures were dull and quite dead;
Seems nothing absorbing was said.
He'd hear students boo,
"We don't cotton to you."
Now he's writing the textbooks instead.

Will my gardens spring back and endure?
Many potherbs sprout blossoms, mature.
Like some dry, bitter weed,
They'll soon bolt: go to seed —
Next year's herbs for our table secure.

I can write about cars, or may choose
To write stories on brakes — news and views
On what's current. This scoop,
"BRAKING TEST RESULTS? POOP!"
Is what's happening now — breaking news.

Larry claims twenty lovers (he lies!)
Who pursue him, but Greta replies:
"Even hookers will make
Him say 'Please,' for God's sake!"
Her remark cuts that guy down to size.

Biological parents are free—
If they wish—to beget and then flee.
Caring people who opt
Both to seek and adopt
Others' children are heroes to me.

An examinate? Never, not me,
'Cause examined I don't want to be,
For the first ruddy question
Will cause indigestion
To quite an unheard-of degree.

The body that's called the carotid
In a textbook is easily spotted.
Unrelated to teething,
It regulates breathing—
The purpose for which it was slotted.

An old woman devoured by lust
Found herself a young man, said, "You must
Give me all that you've got.
I'm incredibly hot."
He said, "Wait while I brush off the dust."

Said the astronaut, "We're in a scrape.
This moon trip is not in good shape.
First we slowed to a crawl;
Now we're starting to fall.
Lack of thrust means we make no escape."

Said Elsie, a cunning old elf,
As she stole my most decorative shelf,
"I would craft one from wood,
But my skills are no good,
So I'm craftily helping myself."

"We will die for the hive" is a bees' law;
A peeping tom statute's a sleaze law;
And a Broken Hill salad
Defined in this ballad
As carrot/Kraft/mayo is cheeseslaw.

"I've got to get over the river
Via tightrope," I thought, with a shiver.
"The promos all state:
'Come see Strolin the Great!'
And by God, I have got to deliver."

I've a passion for horror TV,
And I've just seen a show starring me.
Now my leg's in a mess,
And I bet you can't guess—
The film Arthrogram stars my left knee!

On laundry, I'm not really teachable:
At a loss for what stuff isn't bleachable.
So I've made a real mess
Of your navy blue dress,
'Cause I didn't know stains were impeachable.

I'm a grump in the morning for sure —
Call for coffee and quiet de jure.
But my kids laugh and giggle,
Then tickle and wiggle.
(Such ebulliency's hard to endure.)

At a picnic, you'll chew on a spud,
Or you may chew the fat with your bud,
But don't chew like a cow.
Folks will snicker, and how,
If you—proud and out loud—chew the cud.

How's my docibleness? Unsurpassed:
I am easy to teach; I learn fast.
But I shan't attend college:
With my wealth of knowledge,
My classmates would just feel outclassed.

From Tampa way up to Seattle, a
Guy like me travels to battle a
Wrong that is done
To our favorite Hun.
When you mention him, please call him Attila.

An allegory's something symbolic—
Like a sculpture depicting the frolic
Of Daphnis and Chloe,
Whose love was unshowy,
Idyllic, unspoiled, and bucolic.

So this doll comes annoyingly late,
Says she's got to bring me up to date—
On her dumb-bunny friends,
And her wars with split ends—
"Babe, just cut to the sports. I can't wait."

Attorneys in various firms
Have been known by a number of terms:
Words like bloodsuckers, giving
What they do for a living.
(No offense, Hirudinean worms.)

I had a strong bent (inclination)
Toward changing my orientation.
With the straight life cut loose,
I'm now bent (other use
Meaning "gay").  Guys are now my fixation.

It's my feet that are causing my blues:
I've got blisters just starting to ooze.
Every step makes me flinch
As my toes feel the pinch;
I can't wait to break in these new shoes.

The  apple  that falls from the tree
Doesn't go very far, you'll agree.
But, if dropped on a hill,
It could roll to a rill
And then possibly float out to sea.

There's some canine, an unwanted stray,
In our village. He's looking to stay.
Call the dog-whipper quick.
He'll go out with his stick:
"You're not welcome here, mutt. Go away!"

Tell me: someone who moans? Yeah, a moaner.
And one who debones? A deboner.
Now you know what's to come:
Something duh-duh-duh dumb.
Here goes: someone who groans?  Take three guesses.

This carminative heals your tum's swelling. It
Cures your bloat but bestenches your dwelling. It
Is open and shut:
If you've gas in your gut,
This relieves you of wind by expelling it.

The thing that a woman expects
From a babe magnet, frankly, is sex.
But she also must know
There are likely, in tow,
Several women who want to be next.

"Obsessive self-centeredness stinks!"
(Daddy always gets loud when he drinks.)
"For example, there's Jean,
Egomania queen:
Life revolves around her, so she thinks!"

Those ads for "Hired Hand" I'll peruse,
Or some clues I may use from the news.
While this canvassing probe
Takes the patience of Job,
It could save me some wear on my shoes.

When their splitting in two is achievable,
Their bust-apart halves both perceivable
(I'll breast the bare fact,
Leaving cleavage intact),
Then the pair to be parted are cleavable.

Joe Beaver inquired of his maw,
"This tree—should we purchase a saw
To fell it? A chopper?
Would hatchets be proper?"
Said his mother, laconically: "Gnaw."

Like fools, of their money bereft,
We are chasmed—divided or cleft.
We are not closely knit,
Though together we sit
In the Congress­—the right wing and left.

R and H, in an ocular mood
And with altitude's theme to include,
Wrote, "The corn is as high
As an elephant's eye,
And it looks like…" (They must've been stewed!)

A bulletproof vest is a must
When the feds send you in for a bust.
If you're shot in the head
You will still end up dead,
With your bosom eternally trussed.

Doing backbreaking work is my plight,
Since I work like a dog from first light.
But strangely, my wife,
Whose life has no strife,
Is always so tired: "Not tonight."

Here's a finnip — go out and have fun!
Don't you hold back a bit — spend it, son.
You just take these five pounds
And make all the pub rounds!
Now, ain't I the generous one?

...But when God took a hand in the game,
The construction crew swiftly became
A directionless rabble
Whose speech was a babel
Of lingos no longer the same.

If you think that a limerick's a curse,
I assure you there's something that's worse.
It's called doggerel, ma'am,
A poetical sham —
It means low-down irregular verse.

Meesa think about Star Wars a lot.
Jar Jar Binks: heesa pretty good shot.
Meesa really respects
Alla special effects,
But the film issa missin' a plot.

You've gorged on hot fudge 'til it hurts,
So you no longer fit in your skirts.
Then, in spite of your aches,
You've inhaled chocolate cakes.
All those pains seem condign: just desserts.

Among them, there's nary an udder
(Just imagining that makes me shudder),
But they've whiskers, and claws
On their paws.  That's because
They're a cluster of cats, called a cludder.

Why remove all the statues of Lee?
They're important to me. Can't you see?
I think it's insane—
So does Thor, my Great Dane.
Oh, now where is my dog gonna pee?

It's a creature not monkey—not me;
Something more than those chimps—less than we.
Sort of halfway between
A gorilla and teen—
That's your mythical ape-man, you see.

If it's movement you wish to convey,
Clever flow maps may well be the way.
Volume, source and direction
Are there for inspection.
There's no end to what flow maps display.

What's a fettle? I'm so glad you ask it.
I've looked up the word, no hard task: it
Was used for "belt", "girdle",
And "bandage". The word'll
Do, too, for "side-handle on basket".

On the ground, it's a leaflitter crasher,
But when singing from trees, a rehasher
Of other birds' songs;
For more improv it longs.
It's Toxostoma rufum, brown thrasher.

I was out on my rounds selling crystal
On a day return ticket to Bristol,
Since it's cheaper that way
(To return the same day)
And you don't have to carry a pistol.

The crossjack's the lowermost sail
On the mizzenmast — don't let it flail,
But just let her rip,
And away goes our ship.
We're off now to catch us a whale!

We returned, having seen no big game,
Feeling hungry, disheartened, and lame,
Then were told we must chip
In ten bucks for a tip.
I'm ashamed and regret that I came.

Add on method: you need to be knowing
That the interest due's never slowing.
Every month it is paid
On the whole loan, not made
To reflect just the balance still owing.

Our carpenter finished his search
For the wood for our lovely new church.
What he's chosen to use
For the altar and  pews
Is American dark cherry birch.

An Irishman's girlfriend, named Flannery,
Worked nights shelling beans in a cannery.
In Belfast, a shell
Felled her Paddy—the hell
Of a life filled with rife black-and-tannery!

Abalone's a snail of the sea,
With a foot that's as strong as can be.
If that foot became huge,
Could it stomp Baton Rouge?
That's a loada balone to me.

When the tabloids have gotten the goods
On celebrities—Look! Tiger Woods!—
Wives may ask, arms akimbo,
"Was there more than one bimbo?"
Husbands think about shoulds, woulds and coulds.

Our home's a converted old mill
Nestled into the slope of a hill.
The interior's changed:
Gussied up, rearranged,
But our ivied old walls—dressed to kill.

Humpty Dumpty sat firm as a rock
While explaining the poem "Jabberwock-
y"—the badger-like toves,
And the sad borogoves,
And brillig: about four o'clock.

I considered the dish of the day
At a lackluster Baghdad cafe.
On the chef's bad advice,
I was served "Condi Rice",
Which the chef made a hash of, they say.

To aging I'm hardly averse;
I have learned there are many things worse.
I am near eighty-eight,
And I know it's too late
For a shift in my life to reverse.

I should point out I don't want a poke
From you pointlessly spear-totin' folk.
And there's no need to harp
On the cuspal and sharp
Pointed end of your blade. And your joke.

If you know that you cannot but fail
('Cause you're travelling, sick or in jail)
To be present the day
When we say "aye" or "nay",
Send your absentee ballot by mail.

Deserving of Mace as a spritz
Is a ditz writing rhymes just like this.
It isn't a crime
If you can't make a rhyme,
But scatterbrains give me the fits.

"I am loving this minty ice-cream,
With its flavoursome taste, quite supreme,"
Said the small boy, enjoyably,
And sleepily. "Annoyably —
Annoyingly, I mean — it's a dream."

Till you rid the whole basement of mold,
Their deposit a lawyer will hold:
"Put in escrow", we say.
When the mold's gone away,
Then your home at that point can be sold.

The hands of the potter reveal
Hidden shapes in the clay on the wheel.
Ceramics are fired
In a kiln, but inspired
Is the potter who's fired by zeal.

Human avarice hurts the prized horse,
Who wins profits for men on the course.
What becomes of him when
He stops winning? Why, then
He gets flogged into fields to graze gorse.

For edge, what's a five-letter word?
An answer, uncommonly heard,
Is board—it's surviving
In seaboard, deriving
From border. (I'm sort of a nerd.)

Back when "KAH-noo-way" made its debut,
I had said (and I bet you did too):
"Though the scent is audacious,
The name's ostentatious.
I think I'll just call it kuh-NOO."

Your painting's unskilled. It looks like
It was dabbed on by some little tyke.
I can't sell it—it's awful!
This should be unlawful!
It's daubry! Now take a hike, Ike!

The bell is the captain's (not ship's),
And he rings it (for help with the grips).
When the luggage looms large
It's the bell captain's charge
To dispatch it through bellboys (for tips).

As a smuggler, I knew very well
I'd be welcomed my first day in Hell.
I'd brought ice and cold beers.
All my friends gave three cheers:
"That's just aces!" they cried. "Really swell!"

Western fence lizards used to abound
On my house and the ground all around.
Now I see very few
Of these blue-bellies. True!
There aren't many, round here, to be found.

The Conversion of Grass into Cheese,
The Remarkable Lawns of Belize,
How Our Grasses Survive,
20 Grass Lover Drive—
Agrostographers wrote all of these.

I'm a skinflint, and some call me, "creep" —
Every price that I see is too steep.
I will never leave tips,
But I will purse my lips.
Even birds on the street say, "Cheap, cheap."

Show epanodos: that is my plan,
In this thirteen-foot limerick span:
Though it scans, it's a crime
If the words do not rhyme;
Though they rhyme, it is vital they scan.

Sure, I killed Chainsaw Critic, that slut.
She defaced my bold Cube. See? — she cut
The best corner. She shan't
Make another skewed cant.
My case here is open and shut.

A detention house—that's what it's called—
Is deluged with delinquents. They're hauled
Into court by police,
Who then herd them like geese,
To be jailed in a place that's high-walled.

The word center can mean a location.
For the arts will imply dedication
Of a place to the viewing
Or hearing or doing
Of art, in the world or the nation.

Those dysentery blues, I sure got 'em;
The world's fallen out of my bottom.
As it runs down my legs
It smells worse than bad eggs,
And I can't put on pants—it would rot 'em.

Homer's Iliad and Odyssey first,
The Aeneid by Virgil — well versed,
But as epics, they wended
Through yarns too extended.
Mahabharata? That was the worst.

Broken Holmes: "They split assets of Scots on
Divorce. But mum might raise the tots on
Dad's payments till teens.
If mum chases dad's means,
Why, it's aliment harry, dear Watson!"

Dracontium: genus of plant
With a stench that will never enchant.
Flowers are unisexual,
Though not ineffectual.
Can they mate with themselves? No, they can't.

In your blood there's a swell kind of cell:
Eosinophils help you get well.
An invasion site found?
Send this leukocyte hound—
Those intruders are bound to catch hell.

"Cease loading": an order bestowed
Upon men while in warmaking mode.
More than simply "Cease fire,"
It's one level higher:
"Don't shoot and don't even reload."

When we hold things in common, we share:
Common views; mutual traits that we bear—
As in music, some keys
Use the same chords, and these,
As they're shared, are the keys' common fare.

The cockerel served chickens apace,
But he found himself needing more space.
With shells getting smashed,
His ardour had crashed,
And he'd wound up with egg on his face.

They would place the state under duress,
Not an aim that I share, I confess.
Just one side they assail,
Though to little avail.
Still, they keep crying out "BDS".

"That junk food you need to escape.
This will lead to a healthier shape,"
Said a diet prescriber
Of soluble fiber,
Nuts, greens, and soy protein.  "Go ape."

There's a type of dianthus, clove pink,
Whose age is unknown. People think
It has ancient relations
With modern carnations'
Ancestral botanical link.

On the floor, our sorbet-like dessert.
For the cleanup, we'll use this old skirt:
We expect that its twill
Will absorb all the spill,
While its surface adsorbs all the dirt.

In Australia, my favorite aunt's
Backup phrase for bee's knees is ant's pants,
Which is strange, since my mama's
Is "Wow! Cat's pyjamas!" —
Two sisters, two praisers, two slants.

In America, even a fool
Who's decided to drop out of school
Can succeed — in fact, lead
The whole country.  Indeed,
We're now under boobocracy rule.

Now I swim the Great Barrier Reef
Overcome by unspeakable grief.
Where the coral once flourished,
It now looks malnourished,
Its life dispossessed by a thief.

Though she yearned for a knight on a courser,
Her father was able to force her
To marry Kumar
Who was coarser by far.
She complained; now he wants to divorce her.

Have you heard of the sand lance, my pretties
(Of the genus of fish, Ammodytes,
That includes sand eels, too)?
To protect them, it's true
That the UN should form some committees.

Guess I'll show all them high-brow elites —
Since it's true that you is what you eats,
Then to write verses good
I did just like I should:
Spent the week eating well-measured beets.

This spectacular pot will amaze!
Let's just hope that the surface won't craze.
It has crystals in tangles
Of sparkles and spangles—
I've made an aventurine glaze.

"Jack, I'm back in the saddle again —
Back in business!"  "Oh yeah, Glen? Since when?"
"Since I started Viagra —
Then came a Niagara
Of ladies who love virile men."

I went to the London zoo, where
I saw a poor bear without hair.
I don't know if that's bad,
But I felt very sad.
I can't bear to behold a bare bear.

This spaghetti's pathetic. Each strand
Tastes like nothing at all. It's so bland!
The sauce could be nice
With a wee bit of spice,
But this flavorless stuff I can't stand.

As phirst aid, Dame Sophronia Phelps
Prefers coal oil and various kelps.
Using coal oil in lamps
Aids by saving on amps—
Phrugal Phreddie avers that it helps.

I am fighting my love of dessert
With a therapy plan that's covert.
I imagine that pie
Makes me horribly die,
Though I'm keeping it under my shirt.

He and I stumble home around dawn.
He's all horny; I'm pooped and withdrawn.
I feel ready to wither;
He motions "come hither,"
But I just come hither and yawn.

To counterweigh something, you push
Back against it with shoulders or tush.
Or you might employ rocks
Or a dumbbell or blocks
(Or a vote that repudiates Bush).

My hands were all over your bod.
No, I shouldn't have touched you, by God!
And I'm very ashamed
It was you who got blamed.

Sweetie, feelingly yours,
"Uncle" Rod

Domiciliary care and attention
(In my home) is too galling to mention.
Those who bring me a pie
Also button my fly,
For infirmity cedes no exemption.

I'm accomplished and thought of as great!
I practiced and practiced—the wait!
All my effort was tough,
And the going quite rough!
Now a master, I'll lay it to fate.

Self-delusion's an interesting thing,
Look at people who think they can sing.
Have you heard karaoke?
Few things are more hokey.
What an earful of pain it can bring!

Little Thomas is acting so silly;
He's pretending a wiener's his willie.
"Stop acting pre-schoolery —
Quit this, Tom, foolery.
And dress yourself — now! — it's too chilly."

My musical's titled Hot Property.
Ironically, sales have gone floppity!
Though the actors both play and sing
Songs like "Conveyancing
(Transfer of Rights)", it's un-stop-at-y.

Hank went out in a hundred and four,
And he's never done better before.
With nine holes left to play,
All he managed to say:
"I will never play golf anymore!"

Asking strangers to spare him a dime,
A once proud, now sad, man sang a rhyme
Of the world's Great Depression —
A plaintive expression
Of joblessness marking that time.

Are "devilkins" demons' relations?
No, they're imps meant for lesser temptations.
(I'd been picturing dozens
Of devilet cousins
In quest of full demonizations.)

Over finding a flat, we've had wrangles;
Looking round — that's a job that entangles.
With my trusty circumferentor
I'm sure to find some for rent, or
At least I'll have covered the angles.

They washed cars—we sold sodas and wienies.
We wore jeans—they were dressed in bikinis.
Why'd their car wash go bad?
Their most gorgeous gal had
An appearance much like Mussolini's.

My attention is easy to sway;
I'm divertible—thoughts go astray.
I would come to the crux,
But my memory sucks
(I forgot what I started to say).

Mom's embroidery's second to none,
The fine finger-work perfectly done,
Not a thread misaligned.
Yet Mom's legally blind
And still stitching — a young ninety-one.

Let us constellate here in this place:
We can gather together and trace
Our ancestral connection
With mutual affection.
(The black sheep, since they're dead, we'll embrace.)

Saw a chap, and inside something snapped.
My attention was fully enwrapped.
All my hopes and my dreams
Now involve him, it seems—
I'm completely engrossed and entrapped.

On manors medieval, they'd plough.
They were bond tenants, ox and/or cow
Herders, tillers of ground.
If you're looking around,
You'll find very few acremen now.

We use bondstones when building your wall
To add strength, and they're placed so they're all
Laid with axes right through
The wall's thickness, so you
May be sure that the wall will not fall.

Though Pope Eugene I was a saint,
Here and now wildly famous he ain't.
Were he living today,
"That's Eugene," he might say,
"Though that's really my only complaint."

When younger, the bulk of my crimes
Had netted me nickels and dimes.
But nowadays, bills
Are the fruit of my skills;
I suppose I've just changed with the times.

When a lady's egg meets with a sperm,
They combine, and the outcome's a germ.
Some forty weeks later
(If still in its mater)
The fetus is classed as full-term.

Every time my car's engine turns round
It emits an unusual sound
Like a fart.  My mechanic
Says, "Don't start to panic.
Poor gasketing, that's all I found."

I must say this painting is quaint.
A masterpiece — that it sure ain't.
The artist, one judges,
From seeing the smudges,
Just daubed a blank canvas with paint.

He's a person of huge consequentiality,
Once the soul of this rural locality.
Yet why has he slipped,
His great eminence chipped?
Something lurid—some crude triviality.

The bobcat can stalk, leap, and pounce:
Tasty bunnies are caught on the bounce.
Once a dweller in woods,
Now they hang out in 'hoods,
Poaching prey by the pound or the ounce.

You're a false-hearted chiseling sneak,
You philandering two-timing freak!
Oh, you slippery devil,
You're not on the level.
Your trespasses trump  your physique.

It's my axial skeleton: trashed.
Almost all of my bones have been smashed.
Spared my limbs, which is swell,
And my pelvis as well—
Should've heard that "meep, meep!" and then dashed.

In tropical waters live driftfish,
Not reputed as specially swift fish.
Some types fill their bellies
With free-floating jellies,
And seaweed—they're model-of-thrift fish.

Does Mr. Thistle follow our rules?
