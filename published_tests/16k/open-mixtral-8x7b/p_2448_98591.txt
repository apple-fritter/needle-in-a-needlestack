This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible. 



An Andy Gump snake has no chin,
Since its lower jaw's tucked deep within.
Then again, snakey faces
Don't show many traces
Of jaws. None are Jay Leno's twin.

A phallus should be columelliform,
Not beak-like and tiny (rostelliform),
Not stelliform (star-shaped),
More bar- or cigar-shaped—
Like a column, and never scalpelliform.

What a factiose person is he;
The best splinter group maker you'll see —
A fomenter of factions
And mutinous actions,
A "group within group" devotee.

Buccaneerish, he walks on a peg:
He'd mistaken a black powder keg
For a barrel of grog
In the midst of a fog.
Now he's using a log as a leg.

A repetitive tyke, name of Michael,
Likes to cycle as far as his trike'll.
But he always comes back
To his house for a snack,
Where he started, completing the cycle.

It's five and the numbers are turning.
Now four and to space we are yearning.
Next three, two, and one
And the countdown is done—
Ignition!  The boosters are burning!

I've craved salads for supper since dawn,
But not teaspoons of chicken upon
Shredded lettuce, a bed
Nigh as high as my head.
This strange supper is over.  I'm gone.

I'm obese, and it's true—there's a lot o' me,
But my right and left legs? A dichotomy.
In my left there's a vein
That is causing great pain,
And I'll soon undergo a cirsotomy.

Antidotal  means made to oppose
Any toxin that Medicine knows,
Till its poison abates.
Anecdotal relates
To a story recited in prose.

I love dwarsliggers: very small books
One can carry in all kinds of nooks;
Made of paper as thin
As an onion's slim skin;
Cell-phone sized, well-designed, with good looks.

Massive earthslips are no fun at all.
So stay clear when you see a part fall
Off a mountain or hill
Or a cliff. Better still:
Hide behind a stout fence, or a wall.

Thanks to leaving the tailgate ajar,
I've a sheep and a goat in my car,
Plus a thing used for spying
And something for tying.
Eye, kid, ewe, knot.  Look — there they are!

I just can't get a handle on sex,
Understand when my body connects
With some sweet-smelling fox
With a bod that just rocks —
How to cope with this thing that erects.

Among pastors, BD was once famed,
But in modern times BD's renamed.
Not just single and male
(Or divine) can prevail;
Those who earn this degree are acclaimed.

I'm a fool for a banquet or luncheon,
And my double chin's doubled from munchin'.
So I'm getting my jaws
Wired shut, which should cause
A reversal of four-chin to one-chin.

Our children are noisy.  Their clatter
Makes their dad get as mad as a hatter;
But I calm Dad's attacks,
And I tell him, "Relax,
Matt, it's normal. Their battles don't matter!"

If it's raining and just won't relent
So that mold-bred conditions present
In your cellar, don't cry.
I had dampness, too. I
Filled the space with twelve loads of cement.

The Bible Belt: Here is a phrase
That brings back my altar boy days,
When a wine-induced buzz
(Sacramental it was)
From some belts led to bibulous praise.

To Brock's book I have written a foreword—
Introductory piece—not one more word.
He complains I'm a jerk
And I've pushed his great work
On the glories of boating—well—shoreward.

For soothing, no drug can surpass
Analgesics (the pain-killing class).
Two aspirins will do
To relieve aches from flu,
But they won't cure a pain in the ass.

The beautiful carpet I bought
Left me angry and deeply distraught.
I learned from my neighbor
It was made with child labor;
Such practices ought to be fought.

The auction had reached record highs,
With two bidders both chasing one prize.
"Do I hear…" Tom re-uttered,
Then morbidly muttered,
"This event may go on 'til one dies."

Cornish pasty — a pie for a miner;
As a portable lunch nothing's finer.
It keeps everything in
(So no need for that tin),
As the pastry's both wrapper and liner.

Some aliens landed nearby
And borrowed our neighbor, old Sy.
They returned him intact,
But tattooed with exact
Instructions for shipping by sky.

Rain outside.  Guess I knew what her face meant
When I came up the stairs from the basement.
"It's the window!" she cried.
"We've got weather inside!"
Can't avoid it — we need a new casement.

Can you tell me why day turns to night
And a wandering ten-year-old might
Grow up stay-at-home-y? E-
nantiodromia?
Growth into opposites? Right.

The dead coxcomb was clearly maniacal —
Spent his paychecks on clothing dandiacal.
When that fop was interred,
'Twas no shock I preferred
Not to praise him nor be elegiacal.

The heyday of dial-up has passed.
We use broadband connections with vast
Rates of transfer these days.
Do you miss those old ways,
Using phone lines and modems (not fast)?

Astronauts, please all take note:
The things into space that you tote,
Which stay safe and sound
Way down here on the ground,
In agravic environments, float.

At our college's freshers' bazaar,
The God squad cried, "Follow the star
That leads us to Jesus,
Love, mercy — join (please) us..."
But, me? I shot straight to the bar.

Propranolol has the proclivity
To squelch autonomic activity,
So keep beta blockers
In handbags and lockers
If your heartbeat displays aggressivity.

In the Scotland Act, draughtsmen made mention
Of the famed European Convention.
By the terms of its grant,
The Scots Parliament can't
Breach Convention rights — not sans contention.

If book burning ought to be banned,
Should the banning of books on command
As well be abhorred,
When a library board
Bans a book upon public demand?

To encourage Priscilla's surrender,
Elvis Presley had managed to send her
A daiquiri mixed
With a drug she then nixed
As she labeled it: "Return to blender."

The clergy and clerical men
Can be said to be clerkly — but then
If your handwriting's neat
And your copies complete
You are said to be clerkly again.

As a host, I am no rank beginner,
So each guest at our table's a winner.
Some think finicking chic,
But all you do's critique,
And no doryphore joins us for dinner.

I can eat crookneck squash by the peck,
From its rump to its thin curvy neck.
Sliced and steamed, yummy sweet!
Lightly grilled, tasty treat!
Yellow skinned—it's a fruit? What the heck!

When my dockmackie bloomed, my ol' Paw
Said "Now, son, that there shrub's possum haw."
Maw cried, "Naw — that's vahburn'em!"
Those words! I can't learn 'em,
I'll grow 'em, but names I'll ignaw.

Our subject today: global warming.
Will the planet see hot spells and storming?
The woman I wed
Is so chilly in bed,
I'm more worried an ice age is forming.

Aventurescence can make your eyes dance
At a gem's sparkling air of romance.
Tiny platelets ensure
That this glittering lure
Isn't missed a ventura, "by chance".

This "lily" may cut itself free;
Its stem may be moved A to B.
And most crinoids today
Are less likely to stay,
But freely, they move through the sea.

The future looked stormy and dark
When Noah was building his ark
To be the salvation
Of all of creation
(Excepting the whale and the shark).

You're a wee bitty pished? Get some suet.
Add a dollop of oil from the cruet
(This'll ease its way through).
If the taste just won't do,
Add some mince — either do or don't chuet.

Predaceous and primitive fish,
Gars find other fish very delish.
With sharp teeth and long jaws,
They will hunt without pause.
And they're edible — one's on my dish!

Intelligence level should never
Be judged upon earnest endeavour.
Through experience, I find
Exercising the mind
Doesn't actually make you more clever.

My computer is making me blue
'Cause it's showing a message from you,
That you'll go before long.
Can the pixels be wrong?
If it's on my display screen, it's true.

With bulk purchasing, here's your first clue:
Just buy basics, like kangaroo stew.
Once I happened to spy
A full lifetime supply,
And the price was so low I bought two.

An estuary, experts agree
Is where rivers get wide, meet the sea.
Bounds are hard to define;
For the Thames, a straight line
From North Foreland to Harwich? Search me.

I can dig out my car when it snows,
Or the mucus gone hard in my nose;
We can dig in at dinners,
Discuss local  sinners,
And dig up some dirt about those.

The far right is the stance of this team,
And the speeches they give make me scream.
My temper I lose
When they're stating their views.
Just traditional? No! They're extreme.

I suppose I was mostly to blame
When I suddenly burst into flame.
One shouldn't aspire
To sit near the fire
When Danger is one's middle name.

For a bird, a formidable chore—
With a crowbar he jimmied the door.
The barkeep said, "Whoa!
In this bar there's a crow!
It's a first—never had one before."

These flowers are prettily tinged,
With centers, so dark they look singed,
Shading out to a hue
Like the sky's dawning blue.
And the petals are fimbriate — fringed.

Two patrons, each one a big spender,
To a barmaid flash large legal tender.
She, wanting their tips
But not pinches or lips,
Keeps 'em sober so they don't offend 'er.

When Amara awoke, her cat Jinx
Sat atop her, an aspirant sphinx
Tickling black whisker tips,
Puffing air past her lips,
And she gasped, "Rescue breathing sure stinks!"

There once was a skilled ambidexter,
With little that ever perplexed her.
With two phones she was deft,
Texting friends, right and left,
But to do so while driving still vexed her.

Measure air pressure? Buy a barometer.
Strides taken? You need a pedometer.
My fondest notion's
To depth-check the oceans;
For that, my best bet's a fathometer.

Our most serious faces we don
As the blamestorming session goes on.
Someone died. Who's to blame?
The one person we name
Is a janitor's helper named Juan.

"Your new phone can take pictures with ease,
Plus can tell you the time overseas.
Paying bills is a snap—"
"I don't need all this crap!
Sir, defeature my phone for me, please!"

You can see that I haven't the bod
To get pregnant; I'm male.  So it's odd,
You may think, that I suffer
What my wife does.  No bluffer
Am I.  This condition's couvade.

Each cross-cove has got his own game.
There's the buz and the clout (much the same),
And the crack and the cadge
And the drag. Each a badge
Of one's work. Every lurk has its name.

Calculational methods include
Both the simple-to-do and the shrewd:
I use fingers and toes
To compute with; a rose
Gets a cutie to pose in the nude.

The Full Upminster's often in use
To mean more than a dozen screws loose.
Beyond Barking (no buts)
Means you're totally nuts
And for madness you've every excuse.

A location not up- or downstream,
Of a boat on the water, would seem
To indicate you
Are at right angles to
That vessel, defined as abeam.

Dilys hands in assignments complete
And on time.  Other pupils she'll beat
Through sheer effort (a lot).
She's considered a swot:
Always diligent, focussed and neat.

Each throttle-grip's shaped like a ball,
And on take-off (you don't want to stall)
"Max throttle!" you grunt
And you shove them up front
To the firewall: all balls to the wall.

The lap dancer slowly undressed;
My face was soon deep in her chest.
"Bathycolpic," I cried—
As I smothered, near died—
Is the term that fits this mama best.

Said my broker with consummate charm,
"This sure thing won't be causing you harm."
So I risked it — how dumb!
My success didn't come.
Lost the ranch that I bet and the farm.

When somebody fails to deliver
What's promised, does rage make you quiver
And curse, fling abuse?
You accept his excuse?
I deduce you're an expert forgiver.

In cities with streets upon streets,
And cross-streets, which each of them meets:
Watch rectangles form
(Not squares, as the norm)—
Called blocks, as the pattern repeats.

The world saw a woman named Susan
Meet judges whose game was refusin'.
Boyle trumped their regime
When she sang of her dream—
And now with a chauffeur she's cruisin'.

"What's my destiny? What is my fate?"
"In astronomy, mate, you'll be great.
You will measure the density
Of the cosmic immensity—
It's mass over volume—you'll rate."

The old pro, in his stance, loosed a fart
(Twelve tacos for lunch wasn't smart!),
And the roar from his ass
Made  his line  jump en masse.
Ref yelled,  "Five yards—line movement—false start!"

Cholangiography's my expertise—
I am licensed and have two degrees
In this x-ray technique
That is used when we peek
At your bile ducts in search of disease.

Though it looks like brown sugar's refined
Somewhat less than the common white kind,
There is no taste that's fairer
Than sweet Demerara.
Is that song by the Stones on your mind?

When I first heard the term carrot cake,
I thought, "Who in their right mind would make
A dessert out of carrots?
Perhaps this dish merits
A drink like a nice broccoli shake?"

Cold water! That's what has been thrown
On my plans for a flat of my own
When I summer downtown
In old London.  A frown
From my papa: "No living alone."

Dissymmetry: things lacking grace,
Like both eyes on one side of my face.
What had bothered my ma so,
Inspired Picasso.
My portrait's all over the place!

In Bangalore, puffing a smoke,
A spice trader sauntered, and spoke:
"The spices in Bangy
Are tasty and tangy!
They hang from my bangy, a yoke."

My dad isn't ruled by the trends.
He contends that contentment depends
On controlling temptations,
Loving all God's creations,
And a circle of trustworthy friends.

In the shower and kitchen, no doubt,
You do not want the wet to seep out.
It'll mildew and crack
The whole floor, front to back.
Do not grouse! Seal your tiles with grout.

A crane can swing loads on a hook,
And a person can crane for a look.
A white, whooping crane
Favors marshy terrain,
Where the bird's favorite food can be took.

With threats and coercion at play,
He compelled me to see things his way.
He's the arm-twisting kind —
Quite persuasive, I find.
(He'll keep secret the fact that I'm gay.)

Didn't proffer his hand.  Just a slip?
Gave a partisan speech.  Ego trip?
It was full of self-praise
Though our state's in malaise.
The House Speaker's response: Let 'er rip!

Folks who give and forget I call blessed.
(Bums who take and forget I detest.)
Souls whose kinda kind deeds
Serve their hedge-heaven needs
May be blessed, but I'm much less impressed.

As an author of verses, I face
The revenge of odd rogues I disgrace,
So I'll make it quite clear
That the parts I hold dear
Have been moved to a safe secret place.

You're the heir, as it now lies revealed,
Though the union has long been concealed.
'Twas not blessed by a minister
And so there's a bend sinister
Heraldic device on your shield.

Asiago's a cheese I would rate
As the one cheese you'd want on your plate.
It's more pungent than cheddar
And, if you've a shredder,
When grated it really tastes great.

Victor Borge was one happy Dane,
While young Hamlet felt sorrow and pain.
Hans C. Andersen, though,
Always banishes woe
When he takes you down storybook lane.

Said a robber of cradles named Unger,
"The women I date are much younger.
In that crowd, I'm renowned
Because word gets around
That I satisfy sexual hunger."

Don Juanism: that's when a man
Tries to sleep with each woman he can—
Every Donna, Georgette,
April, Jill, Kate, Yvette,
Christy, Monica, Eve, and Sue Ann.

Alliteration in limerick oration
Applied with some lip lubrication
And a light, rolling lick
Or a rough, flirting flick
Will likely result in elation.

Mental/physical slowness you see.
Closed-head injury when I was three
Killed off brain cells.  Repair
(Or cytothesis)?  There
Is no way.  Just accept me as me.

Social scientists' studies all posit
That from Boston to London and Oz, it
Is not an enigma,
But owing to stigma,
That gay people stay in the closet.

My cousin, the late Comrade Harriet,
Ran the Soviet's bread commissariat
That inspected each bakery
For graft, fraud, and fakery;
She was loved by the whole proletariat.

At first light, when my slumber is deep,
The dawn chorus revs up—and I weep.
Birdsong shatters the air.
Woken up, I don't care
For its beauty. I just want to sleep!

That's a dirty stock; should you resell,
With the paperwork all won't be well.
Good delivery? No, sir;
And the firm is so-so, sir —
Runs brothels, or so I've heard tell.

A friendly young barbet called Maggie
(A French water dog, kind of scraggy),
Was stunned when she heard
Barbet's also a bird
(Very colorful, not at all shaggy).

Disencrese is now written decrease.
If you still use the former, please cease.
Folks will update, I've heard,
This now-obsolete word
From your writing at two bucks apiece.

In blank verse there's a good rule of thumb
You must follow when writing, and some
Find this discipline sweet —
Lines have five iamb feet;
Though non-rhyming, they bounce to "di-DUM".

But Don John's a malevolent foe:
He's a back-stabbing traitor, and so
He says Claudio's tricked,
And Don Pedro has picked
That young maid for himself. Oh, the woe!

At politics, Fred was a master,
So his progress went faster and faster.
His aim was to rate
In Defense or in State,
But his brinksmanship led to disaster.

All the students were locked in his stare.
Their soiled souls needed cleansing and care.
One dumb boor acted crass;
Raised a cheek and passed gas.
How much grief should a poor yogi bear?

In the forest, in Queensland, at night,
Be alert for a seldom seen sight.
It's a tree kangaroo
Called a boongary—you
Likely won't catch a glimpse.  But you might.

The press release only said we
Had agreed to, in fact, disagree.
So no progress was made,
And as hopes of it fade,
It all sounds like a cop-out to me.

Come the finals, a dance-off's intense.
Though they've practiced, demands are immense.
What at last will decide
Involves magic and pride,
Then the grit to survive the suspense.

Oppressors annihilate foes
By using some terrible blows.
The civilians must hide,
And attend those who died:
Bombardment spawns terrible woes.

"Come to taco me, Emily, chum?"
"Taco Em" came to: "Coat me in rum!"
"Why coat Em?" Tom Ace thought.
"When to Mace her I ought."
"You're a comet—you had me at 'Come'!"

By Orde Wingate the Chindits were led
Through the jungles of Burma then fed
And supplied 'anywhere'
By the U.S. 1st Air,
While avenging an infamy's dead.

The majority party agree
With borders of zones to make free.
Re-shaping the sectors
Will split the electors,
So a swing in the vote they foresee.

Maybe you and your spouse have a spat.
You can pick up your iPhone and chat
With a certified shrink
Who'll respond in a wink.
Did you know there's an app just for that?

Thus far, I'd no dating success.
As yet, I have failed to impress.
Up till now, I'd no clue
Why girls feel as they do.
Then I looked in the mirror — "Ah, yes."

So your interests in life, like the rain,
Have been channelled in water's domain?
Then these deep springs of knowledge
You learned back in college
Are geohydrology's gain.

Cheddar pink is a flower, so please
Don't assume it's some mold on your cheese.
And because of its name,
This dianthus can claim
To be gorgeous (to punsters and bees).

"Please, bring me some water!" I cry.
"I'm feeling completely adry!
Fetch a glass or a cup;
Hurry, please, fill it up...
Oh, and add a few jiggers of rye."

In this city, my uncle is mayor.
My aunt is D. Trump's chief purveyor,
But my cousin's a brawler,
A battler, a mauler;
They refer to him as an "affrayer."

My friend Jennifer gets all the action—
Twice her share of the sweet satisfaction.
Why's it doubled for Jen?
She dates women and men:
A bisexual kind of attraction.

Miss Muffet, that tuffeted lass,
Can't bluff it, with nerves made of glass.
Her arachnophobia,
Really, can so be a
Pain, if a spider should pass.

At a doorway, a dastardly deed
Is to let someone else take the lead.
If you think you're a cutie,
Say, "Age before beauty,"
While letting the other proceed.

Telling pooches to cwtch means "lie down"
When you're each in some cushy Welsh town.
If you want to look butch,
Then you'd better not cwtch
The dogs' owner—he'll shoot you a frown.

I've dusted the dance floor with powder
(French chalk), and I couldn't be prouder:
Girls aglow and boys tall
At the graduate ball,
They'll recall they made summer come louder.

With back-alley, you've got to beware,
Since the term denotes substandard care.
Plastic surgery can
Take this adjective. (Man,
There are "back-alley nose jobs" out there?)

I hear decadence, more so decay,
For the "falling down" ways of today.
But I'd say the word decidence,
Which shares Latin precedents,
Appears to have fallen...

Don't go swimming in freshwater seas,
Since they're brimming with waterborne fleas.
These cladoceran pests
Become nose-squatting guests
Who won't leave till your fiftieth sneeze!

Acetyl CoA is required
When a two-carbon fragment's desired:
Biosyntheses that
Make a steroid or fat
Have such two-carbon transfers hard-wired.

If you're after an excellent match
Then you'll find I'm the best of the batch:
Perfect gent, never late,
Always pays on a date;
All in all, I'm one hell of a catch.

Your neurons have axons: you think.
These axons keep brain cells in sync.
A membrane surrounds them
(Axolemma); this bounds them,
Allowing your axons to link.

On bank:  bridge abutments there rest.
En banc: to all judges attest.
In bank: where the money
Had best not be funny—
You bank on it being the best.

Go to Aalsmeer to bask in the biz
Of a bloom auction—biggest there is!
Here's some friendly advice:
Once you bid, that's the price!
If some guy bids before you, they're his.

The tall ladder and winch and the rope meant
The scene had been set for elopement.
"No big church has the room
For our love!" claimed the groom,
But "I'm stingy" was more what that dope meant.

I am, don't you know, an artiste,
Once a guest at a grand White House feast.
Baryshnikov danced,
And Seabiscuit pranced,
While the national debt just increased.

You like snow caps? Our Andes are fine.
Quito's churches are lovely, divine.
We've got deep jungle reaches,
Galápagos, beaches.
We're the nation that's named for a line.

You poor blockheads, you pay a big price.
You're so cubelike, you don't look so nice.
Six square faces don't please
Joined at ninety degrees —
Plastic surgery ought to suffice.

The lighthouse up there on the left?
Of meaning, it seems quite bereft.
It alludes to Nantucket
(And Nan and her bucket.)
To know this, you'd need to be deft.

We've ascended so high in the skies
That our airplane can no longer rise.
At this absolute ceiling,
I'm getting the feeling
A parachute might have been wise.

Phil, a groundhog, we treat as a seer.
From his burrow, each year he'll appear
In mid winter (2/2).
If he's scared by the view
Of his shadow, spring weather's not near.

In our rugby club, non-playing Mick,
Who's in management, sure makes me sick.
Match day comes, he falls through.
Damn this alickadoo!
What the hell does he do?  Not a lick.

I asked, "What is that strange-looking thing, Gus?"
"I'm not sure; Mingus called it a dingus.
This strange gizmo, this doodad —
Let's hope that it's true, dad! —
Some good luck will bring us, per Mingus."

"Father Patrick? You know that old key
To the ambry? Please lend it to me.
Holy oils in their jars
Fill that cupboard. My car's
Lubrication is low … Father P?"

Boudoir is the name of a spot
Whose mere mention gets men really hot.
That this term of such grace
Means in French: "sulking-place",
I believe may explain quite a lot.

A capsule matures fully dry,
And then sheds all its seedy supply
Through a split or through pores
To the ready outdoors:
Some kinds scatter nearby; others fly.

"Jimmy Olsen?" you ask, "'Who is he?"
Photojournalist — new, who you'll see
Pals with Lois and Clark.
Are you still in the dark?
Cub reporter, the Planet, low key.

I hammered it back through the box,
Knocking Danny clean out of his socks.
Dan's a pitcher and he
And the others agree
We don't flinch from line drives 'cause we're jocks!

I've been burning down houses without
Any breaks for a fortnight, about,
And I've started to keep
Seeing flames in my sleep—
Truth to tell, I've been feeling burnt-out.

He's little and fuzzy and grey
And Australian. While lounging all day,
This marsupial eats
Eucalyptus leaf treats.
"Cute coala, I wish we could play!"

Immature little glob on a plant,
Be a flower, bud — grow and enchant.
Spread your wings and let fly.
Don't let spring pass you by —
Do not tell me you won't or you can't.

A bubbleheaded man is a fool:
Simple, silly, or dumb, and a tool.
If he's tutored, he might
See the light—get it right,
But the chances are slight, as a rule.

When people are phobic, you'd think
That their fears disappear with a drink.
Yet if liquor's their fear
(Whether mixed drink or beer),
Dipsophobics should see a good shrink.

Lacking implants to augment their boobs,
This one doc thought his patients such rubes
That, unfazed, he would slice,
And throw in fuzzy dice—
Now they're cubical (shaped just like cubes)!

There once was a man from the States,
Who asked several women on dates.
From this courtship en masse,
He acquired, alas,
Not a wife, but a tangle of mates.

Done the trick was once quite untoward,
As its meanings were not in accord:
There was (1) "(Up) You've won!",
And too (2) "(Down) You're done!".
Cleft like cleave, 'twas a double-edged sword.

Once abundant, the threatened cahow
Is a bird rarely heard, even now.
Still this petrel survives
In Bermuda and strives
To revive, if conditions allow.

I sure hope, come the next big election,
We can turn from our bitter direction:
Bush has torn us in two
(Half in red, half in blue)
By dividing us § by §.

In Aintab the pistachios are cool,
And if you don't like 'em, you fool,
You will just have to sit tight,
'Til condemned by a Hittite
To a punishment nutty yet cruel.

Defacement is done to a wall
By a person whose intellect's small —
Or restricted, let's say.
Education today
Doesn't teach them much more than to scrawl.

While it's true disputations obstetric
Might give rise to some real heated rhet'ric,
Just how hot, I confess,
Would be hard to assess
Using measurements calorimetric.

As a Member, I cannot resign,
But it's time to have time that is mine.
I have long served our land,
So present my demand
For the Hundreds of Chiltern.  Please sign.

The Boskops—an eggheaded race
With a very huge brain and cute face—
Were enthralled by pure thought,
So for sex they cared nought:
Thus we bozos have taken their place.

Words peculiar? Sebastian has got 'em. He
Knows them, both toppy and bottomy.
"There's acephal — 'sans head';
Hindwin's 'anus'," he said.
"And for 'simple incision', aplotomy."

All the gals at the country club sneer
When they see their poor waitress appear.
They're so cliquish and clubbish
And treat her like rubbish,
Which is why she just spat in their beer.

This butter is not spread on bread;
It is rubbed on the body instead.
Is it better than lotion?
I haven't a notion.
It could be, but don't be misled.

Some celebrities like to be known
For a fragrance or scent of their own.
The man who played Rocky
Is hawking a schlocky
New aftershave: Eau de Stallone.

The first night of Racine's greatest play
Was no-showed by some fans of Corneille.
Sects and scandal to boot
All contrived to uproot
Or deracinate Jean, I would say.

Baal-hanan made gracious demands
Of the good Lord who gave mankind lands.
Down below in low plains
He prayed mainly for rains
For his olive and sycamore stands.

Bloviators—you've met them, for sure—
Are those folks we, at times, must endure.
They won't leave us in peace,
For their words never cease.
How I wish their disease had a cure!

This old musket of mine is front loading;
Down the muzzle I load, with foreboding.
Yes, the gun is a fusil,
And any misuse'll,
I fear, have the damn thing exploding.

In an age much more biblioclastic
Than ours—oft derided as plastic—
Critics fiercer, though fewer,
Threw books in the sewer.
They hoped to make minds less elastic.

Distinguishably, typeset in lead,
On a calendar, days are all spread.
But the calendar's setter
Makes some days much better
With letters distinctively red.

My pa grew up poorer than dirt;
His suit, worn to church, had no shirt.
But his ma, who was tricky,
Made a white muslin dickey,
(Mock shirtfront) with ruffles so pert.

The nightingale's known for its song
Which is beautiful, tuneful, and strong.
If you say that you've heard
It's the national bird
Of Croatia, you're just partly wrong.

Avaricious,  the landlord from Trent
Was Scrooge-like collecting his rent.
He dismissed his advisor,
Then this covetous miser,
Un-Scrooge-like, refused to repent.

The capo, when Dino demanded
That his share of the take be expanded,
Cried: "No wiseguy gets more
Than the rest.  There's the door!"
He was canned, and he left empty-handed.

Farination means "turning to flour."
Those chickpeas just took me an hour.
Why grind a whole lotta
Legumes? Farinata,
A flatbread I bake and devour.

I love to play chess. It's my joy,
But I just like to win. Now, oh boy!
Since the opening I use
Is now certain to lose,
Should I take back my moves, then deploy?

Fierce debate: how much wood throws a woodchuck
(When well-trained, so he knows what he COULD chuck)?
"I could pitch half a cord
If I didn't get bored.
That's my personal best: it's a GOOD chuck."

They determined their lives worth aligning
As each for the other was pining.
It tugs at your heart
To keep puppies apart,
Especially with all of that whining.

He's purposeless, aimless, a loser;
He's shiftless, a drunk doped-up boozer.
It's a hopeless sad case,
A worst-outcome disgrace—
Get the picture? A down-and-out doozer.

"Doc, those quacks say I've got some psychosis,
But these worms make me itch. Diagnosis?"
Thinks the doctor, "Be gentle,
Since his worms are all mental —
It's delusional parasitosis."

If your neckline is plunging and low,
You may find, when you're out, you're on show.
There are men who may perve at yer
Centre of curvature—
There where the curves touch and go.

Pinned down by the enemy's forces,
We know what our only recourse is—
A daredevil breakout,
In which we will take out
Their cannons (and also their horses).

The cajeput tree is a myrtle—
Australian, invasive, and fertile.
Transplanted, it stands
On Floridian lands,
Where it's shading the gator and turtle.

Sweet aspartame's a health risk? Tee-hee!
Can cause mood swings? Boo-hoo! Sugar-free.
I'm on top of the world.
No! I'd sooner be curled
Up in darkness: the pits. Wait! Whoopee!

Those describing a ship all employ
The word she, for without being coy,
Upon entering port
She will tend to resort
First to tying herself to a buoy.

She's talking of marriage—how dismal.
I'm broke and my future's abysmal.
My life's on the skids
And she wants to have kids.
Is she pregnant? Now that's cataclysmal!

Take a rope and a tree and a wall
And a spear and a serpent and all,
Grab a bag of thick skin,
And then stuff them all in.
It's an elephant! Don't you feel small?

My writing is great, you should know,
Yet you turn it all down.  What a blow!
Your taste is awry,
Else you surely would buy
My submissions.  I'm through.  Keep your dough!

The actorvist (activist actor)
Posed for pictures atop a large tractor.
She says we should eat
More whole grains and less meat.
Her effect on my life?  Not a factor.

No real sleeves on my tee shirt, and yet
My shoulders are covered: you bet!
With hot sun at high noon,
I'd be burnt pretty soon,
But a cap-sleeved top's really no sweat!

It's colorless, volatile, scary—
A flammable liquid. Be wary,
'Cause acrylonitrile,
If given a light, will
Explode, and results could be hairy.

He was suddenly roused from his slumber,
Where in dreams he had failed to outnumber
The foes he would mangle.
He'll now disentangle
His mind, and his soul disencumber.

Ben-Hur won a mighty ovation
In theaters all over the nation;
Though it wasn't the acting
That did the attracting,
But the wonderfully filmed aurigation.

I am seeking the Way I should go
By consulting the augurs I know.
Though attaining some clarity,
There remains some disparity
Between the I Ching and Tarot.

Calabaza's a Mexican squash.
It is simple—not flashy or posh,
But it's cheap and nutritious,
And also delicious.
I'll cook up a batch with panache!

What to frame, and how much to expose;
Which particular sets to disclose;
When to pan or to zoom
To make sense of a room:
What a cinematographer knows.

On the ground a fresh layer of snow
Brought a cheerful suggestion from Moe:
"Let's make snow angels, guys!"
Voted down (no surprise)
By the others: "I think we should go."

Said my friend, "I don't like Arizona.
It's too bland," as he sipped his Corona.

To visit Oak Canyon
Then told him, "Shut up and Sedona."

Your blood pressure needs intervention.
Its precipitous rise
Hits your kidneys and eyes,
As your blood vessels voice their dissension.

Jakob's crimes were especially vile,
Say the charges recorded on file.
The court that will sit
Has two outcomes—acquit
Or convict him. (Bernoulli's on trial.)

Fa: How that note you might hail.
Fad: Passing fancy.
Fade: Seeing's chancy.
Fader: Loud volume curtail.

I am tossing out paper.  I binned
Many sheets to protect from the wind:
IOUs from my debtors,
Old memos, and letters
That document how I have sinned.

In my nautical journal I wrote:
"As I rowed I saw driftweed afloat.
As toward shore the plants drifted,
I reached down and lifted
A handful right into my boat."

Made of cardboard, it's no jewel case,
 But a useful thin box for a brace
(That would be two CDs)
 Tucked in snug as you please,
 Due to digipak's purpose-built space.

My friend, a South African duffer,
Went fishing; returned with a puffer.
He ate it; I shivered.
Its liver delivered
Some poison: blaasop made him suffer.

We've got mendicants working our town:
Gaberlunzies allowed by the Crown.
Folks would cleanse every lane,
But would that seem humane?
So we keep to our homes, hunkered down.

"Bloody Death" was a moonshiner's poochie.
An attack dog, he'd guard all the hooch. He
Was muscular, lean,
Like a canine Marine,
And a pup with whom no one got smoochy.

If you're somewhat a thorn, are you thornish?
If you're miserable, are you forlornish?
You'll be caring, carefree,
Having game hens with me
Down in Cornwall where everyone's Cornish.

A blood-curdling howl from the Scottie
(That is virtually true: blood got clotty!)
To our ears was traumatic.
Damn dog's operatic,
A terrier-ist Pavarotti!

That's my boyfriend in room 23.
True, he's 50 years older than me,
But he's so nice to care for,
So what's he need hair for?
Just look—he's as cute as can be!

The crocodile lives in the river,
And his jaws can deliver a shiver.
As he's smirking beneath
That great mouth full of teeth,
He's contriving to dine on my liver.

If you don't want to hear any lies,
Ask no questions—that's what I'd advise.
I would rather not share
What is too hard to bear.
I won't say if I slept with those guys.

To be sure, I'll cadday — it's far grander
To saunter or stroll or meander.
Whenever I ramble,
I make sure I amble —
A leisurely walk or a dander.

The Chinese have a  calendar buzzin'
With a critter each year. (There's a dozen.)
Are there only twelve fates
For folks born on those dates?
It's as dumb as its zodiac cousin.

It's a crinolined penis (how ... sweet?)
Capped in slime with the stench of foul meat.
I dipped pen into ink-horn
To write of the stinkhorn,
And cooked bridal-veil stinkhorn. Let's eat!

When describing a painting, I'd say
That an ekphrasis might be the way:
Using words germane spent
On the artist's intent,
Make it clear what he meant to portray.

"Now, witness, I've no wish to diss you,
But of lies your whole tale is a tissue.
We will call, to rebut it — "
Says the judge: "Counsel, shut it!
That's just a collateral issue."

If invited to dine by a friend,
Do take wine, but (O Heaven forfend!)
Never buy cheap Shiraz,
Which your nose tells you has
Been exhumed from a musty bin-end.

Some ciderkin's what we will make
From the leftover cider mash. Take
All the skins, cores, and seeds—
Now a worm's all it needs—
Boil in water, then strain and partake.

Her new heifer, the mother expelled.
She didn't seem rattled,
Her nerves were not addled.
At calving, that cow had excelled.

Forty-five! It was Baylor's great year,
When in Texas he crowned his career
As a statesman by founding
A school that's still sounding
The praise of a staunch pioneer.

An elite, discreet Brahmin (Bostonian)
Married well, to a titled Etonian.
Then he lost all their wealth
And she suffered bad health.
So the change to their lifestyle? Draconian.

If you're riding a fast carousel
And feel you're in circular hell,
You surely can guess,
From the Middle East mess,
That President Bush does as well.

"I played classical music," sniffed June.
"Then I learned to play riffs on bassoon."
She now plays, with pizzazz,
Only razzmatazz jazz.
So, in two senses, June's changed her tune.

A new product with somber reviews,
Desaturation in 64 Hues,
Includes four crayon trays
Of blacks, whites and grays
Guaranteed to give children the blues.

A buzz phrase impresses most folk,
Though its meaning for you is a joke.
Say it early and often;
They'll think you're a boffin,
Not a technocrat, jobless and broke.

Could daffodil garlic taste good
In a pasta sauce? Maybe it would,
As it's garlic from Naples,
And one of their staples
Is pasta—it hasta—it should!

Your heart rate was running much higher,
As your cardio workouts require.
So you failed to discern,
Busy feeling the burn,
That your sweatpants were catching on fire.

It's part Colby, part Monterey Jack.
Orange marbled with white,
It makes nachos just right.
Just one taste and for more you'll come back.

Sure, an octopus might use a tool,
But some trivia even more cool?
A consortium's when
There's a lot more than ten.
I suppose they're too smart for a school.

Grith is an old Scottish word.
Rarely now will you find it is heard.
In the case of a waif
That needs help and a safe
House, asylum is there undeferred.

Any child that from now on you gestate
Won't be mine — I declare it! —

"Of a website I've used as of late.
There's a mailbox as well
At this fixed URL
(Though it's lacking a city and state)."

And fatigues us with fine points thereof:
What his lady will wear,
How she dresses her hair,
And (ye gods!) her sweet hand in a glove.

When just a young child I would beg
For a bicycle. Big sister Meg
Had a beautiful one
But my dad said, "Dear son
One like hers costs an arm and a leg!"

Bishops' Bible and Coverdale's balm
Is a treacle too sticky to calm
Their most sulphurous burn.
Read your Potter and learn,
In his Brimstone and Treacle, this qualm.

The Corypha genus is small,
But its fan palms are typically tall.
Once these plants bear their fruit,
It's the end of the route,
Since they die (and eventually fall).

Minor problems crept onto our plate,
But they went unaddressed till too late.
When we started to care,
They were too much to bear,
And a thousand-cut death was our fate.

Just imagine you're pricked by a pin.

From your leg to your brain,
So you know you've been stuck in the shin.

An affliction that sadly is still
A most common trait
In those folks who hate
To put in more effort than nil.

She scooted away. When I said,
"Could you get a bit closer?"
She hissed at me, "No, sir.
I prefer sleeping dissite instead."

How that pic brings to mind good old days!
It reminds me of you on the chaise
In your green-grass-hued gowns
And me making the sounds
Of a cow in the hope of a graze.

As her cervix was opening wide.
With pained little squeaks,
She breathed through the peaks
Of the forceful contractions inside.

Of attempting, lest Nancy should glance
And remark, as I slip, "Oh,
That fellow's a hippo,
So clumsy, he's tripped on his pants."

"Your lead is commanding," I said
To my candidate.  "Way far ahead
Of the next highest guy,
And I think I know why —
All the voters you've conned and misled."

If an orgy's about to begin,
Or you plan to commit some droll sin
Which may give me great pleasure
Or joy beyond measure:
Don't bother to ask — deal me in.

Bambi's flying her bomber today
O'er the Indian city Bombay.
Messing up, she ignores
Bolted-shut bomb bay doors,
Slaps the button, and booms, "Bombs away!"

Her attempts to avoid any friction
Seem to further her husband's addiction.
Her daughter's the labeler:
"You're Poppa's enabler,
And guilty of gross dereliction."

I understand dear Anastasia
Has acquired epileptic aphasia.
Where once she could speak,
And talk on for a week,
Today she's regressed to aphrasia.

That's a drum table, folks, 'cause it's round,
Like a snare drum without that great sound.
Look, the apron has drawers
For the small things one stores.
It's the best Duncan Phyfe style we've found.

I stole Cash but had no place to hide.
I grew Haggard, felt guilty inside.
Serving time was my fate;
Now released, I've gone Strait.
I ain't Rich but I'll still sing with Pride.

"Means that something is south of the Po.
It is closer to home
From the standpoint of Rome;
And to Rome all roads go, don't you know!"

Her behavior was formal, innately.
Although John was a comer,
She judged him a bummer—
An upstart, a Johnny-come-lately.

Aunt Jemima, Aunt Sally, Aunt Jane
Are all negative terms, in the main.
Plus Aunt Mary will do,
Thomasina (Aunt, too),
For black women we highly disdain.

Want to bathe in arcana? Then splurge!
Plunge into the dated.

"To sink or immerse: to demerge".

With a menu of natural food.
There all cell phones are banned,
It's all candle-lit, and
They allow you to eat in the nude.

All this homework will not go away.
Oh my god! I'm so fat!
They all hate me! And that
Is a spot on my nose. Am I gay?

Though amoebas inside may offend,
Our amoebocytes help to defend.
They're our blood cells in white
And intruders they fight—
But just how do they tell foe from friend?

Two cobishops are useful in chess
And I like them so much I obsess.
Sure, I'm playing it wrong,
So this game won't last long.
I should treasure my queen more, I guess.

Count Dracula's fangs needed drilling;
Gold amalgam would be their new filling.
He said he'd behave
If the dentist would save
Any blood that he chanced to be spilling.

The playwriting genius Bert Brecht
Never let 'em know what to expect.
He caused a sensation
Through utilization
Of the alienation effect.

If it's done, you can press Control-P.
It'll print out your page.
Enough ink? Check the gauge
Lest a "Toner low" message you see.

There's B-ball all over the 'hood.
Hey, we'd play every day if we could!
In our hoop-de-doo dreams,
We lead NBA teams
And we dominate Shaq, we're so good.

Artie dreamed as he tramped through the gorse
Of a life as a cowboy. The source
Of his most recent gloom
Is the fact, we presume,
He's allergic, alas, to his horse.

When a couple decides to divorce,
Fair justice a judge must enforce.
So for equity's sake
I believe I must take
A comparative rectitude course.

Prismatic is epidote's habit,
Which you'll see later on in the lab. It
(Well, this one) is green,
And opaque; but I'm keen
On transparent ones. See that rock? Grab it!

Though the groom was soon bedding his bride
Near the spot where their knot had been tied,
Only hours before,
She'd been playing the whore
With the boyfriend she saw on the side.

In a myelin sheath, I espied
Glycolipids (that's "carb-fat", implied).
"Since they're found in the brain,"
I strove to explain,
"I propose the name cerebroside."

The joys of a farm that's collective
Are (how shall I put this?) … subjective.
When your fine crop of hay
Is just taken away,
You have nothing to say but invective.

The angler tells tales of the size
Of the fish that have met their demise.
Credulity stretches
As Fisherman fetches
More beer to embellish his lies.

For the fish we call crossopterygian,"
Said the Captain, succinct.
"They are almost extinct;
And they're holy—to me a re-lig-i-on."

Bound for Rio, we cross the equator
On our rust-bucket Malta-flagged freighter.
Though her hull's less than fit
And she's listing a bit,
Still, we'll clear the holds sooner or later.

Michael's diet has never been sensible.
High in fats, it is hardly defensible,
And he's putting on weight.
Mike opines, "Ain't it great
That my belly is highly distensible?"

The work in the Louvre ain't charmless,
So why not go look? It's quite harmless.
There's lots that's beguiling,
Like Mona, who's smiling,
And Venus de Milo, who's armless.

Said a guy whose divorce just went through,
"I'm so lucky to bid you adieu.
Best of all is I won
At the lotto, and hon,
I don't need to share any with you."

That Revival reached out, going strong,
Marked by barking and swoons through the throng.
There at Cane Ridge, Kentucky,
Some came to "get lucky,"
But left with a call to belong.

"Quite a few" is well known as a lot,
Oft misspelled as one word though it's not.
Alot is an error
That's not getting rarer
And may need its own OEDILF slot.

A dashing young fellow named Barron
Caught the eye of a lassie so carin';
Though his name she soon wore,
The six children she bore
Means we hardly can call the girl barren.

Of all of the seeds I've been sowing,
French marigold's best: well worth growing.
It draws lacewing and fly
With a sharp, eager eye
For bad aphids as soon as they're showing.

Who do they blame in the blamestorming session after someone dies?
