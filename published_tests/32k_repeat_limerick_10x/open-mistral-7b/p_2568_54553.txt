The air rang with many a shout
When the final exam had let out.
In the dorms on the quad,
No one thought this was odd.
(On a campus it's normal, no doubt.)

What's the name of the first navy sub?
Was it sleek or a hand-paddled tub?
Crocodilian by name
But achieving no fame,
'Cause it sank ere it fought—there's the rub.

Erwin Schrödinger places a cat
In a box just to settle a spat
About quantum mechanics:
Do feline organics
Lose 4.5 lives? Figure that!

"I've explored every cupboard and drawer,
And it can't have just dropped on the floor,"
The webserver frowned.
"I've searched all around,
But that page is not found — 404."

My cabbage-like sister loves soup,
Eating bowl after bowl of dull goop.
Its cabbage-like smell
Leaves me feeling unwell.
Now she's serving up me a bowl. Poop.

She was balding and stood six foot eight.
Her enjoyment of garlic was great.
Though I put up a fight,
I was ravished that night.
Disadventure, thy name is "blind date"!

A coquettish young female admeasurer
Once told a farm's impotent treasurer,
"I've one veg to allot—
This shallot hits the spot."
[I shall not end this verse with "to pleasure her".]

Blue cheese has a strong, grown-up taste
I took years to acquire. What a waste!
Now I'm going full-tilt on
Gorgonzola and Stilton,
And will rectify Roquefort post-haste.

To removal I'm forced to consign
The old bridge sagging into the brine.
Its dismantlement's due
To the architect who
First proposed its abysmal design.

When you're driving, ten miles out of town,
And your engine just stops, you may frown.
If you try a repair,
You should exercise care
And just wait till the engine cools down.

At the Cockney Fine Lacemakers Guild,
They're bestowing a trophy for Skilled
Ruffled Ruffs, Cuffs and Collars
On Fanny, who hollers,
"Oh, fanks! — oo'd've fought? — I'm so frilled!"

In your little black dress, you look swell,
And I sure love that "No. 5" smell.
Haute couture (that's "high fashion")
Has filled me with passion
For you, thanks to Coco Chanel.

Deterministically — that's how she dances:
Keeps the beat, but ignores my advances.
She's a needle that moves
In predictable grooves;
She's a poet whose feet take no chances.

Check my mouth and my ears? Yeah, that's fine.
But I'm guarding this body of mine.
You just ain't gonna study
That cavity, buddy—
The one where the sun doesn't shine.

When I think of Dinichthys, I wish
I could actually catch such a fish,
But this kin of the gar
Is a fossil and far
From a fish for a dish that's delish.

Townsfolk need to abbreviate in
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrn-
drobwllllantysilio-
gogogoch, but will go
The whole hog when the spring tours begin.

Not too often (I'd say it's occasional),
I'll use arguments clearly equational:
"And that's why, you see,
A is equal to B!"
All the math majors find these persuasional.

Hugh's appraised the huge house so admiringly,
And assessed their fine art most desiringly.
Now he calls fellow thieves
And insures he achieves
One more link in a life lived conspiringly.

Buster Brown was a comic strip boy,
And his girly good looks he'd deploy.
With his dog that could speak,
This incurable sneak
Would beguile, then annoy or destroy.

That guy's got a whole lot of pals,
But you'll notice there aren't any gals.
Androphilic is he.
He likes "he" over "she" —
A sexist with no rationales.

Ancient Greeks had a flair for design,
And each cylix they made was divine—
Each a model of grace
From its handles to base.
Greeks embraced it for drinking their wine.

Blond capuchin: a monkey so new
There's not one, as of yet, in a zoo.
It was out in the sticks
Of Brazil in '06
That this charmer first came into view.

I've been clearing my throat like a toff,
But it's due to my tickly cough.
I feel rough and sound gruff
At the concert.  "Enough!"
Cry the audience round me. "Clear off!"

Here's a book Dr. Childs has compiled
On this goldfish that lives in the wild.
It's that sharp Crucian carp,
With a tail like a harp.
I observed one—I swear that it smiled.

The historical theory of humors,
Important to healthcare consumers,
Had explained body woes.
Acrimonia, of those,
Once was thought to cause illness and tumors.

Some apéritifs, maybe, to start?
After that, pick the menu apart...
Have you seen the sweet trolley?
We can choose something jolly
From the cart, once we've dined à la carte.

At an opera — or worse — operetta,
You may come to a point where you get a
Sweet tune (cavatina),
And after that's been, a
More animate close (cabaletta).

To ensure that they're clean, first you brush 'em.
The spuds like to be brushed—do not rush 'em.
All the best cooks advise
Those with long stringy eyes
Are no good.  You should just go and flush 'em.

At my school,  I'd a teacher who fed
On the limbs of bad children she'd shred.
Eagle-sighted, she'd pick
Up the tiniest trick.
She had eyes in the back of her head.

The Black Nationalists challenge the Man:
"Yes, we've had it with you and your Klan.
We're asserting our rights
To be free of you whites
And don't care if the sheet hits the fan."

Your computer has slowed to a crawl?
It's your standards for speed.  Now think small.
Double-density floppies,
DDs: I've some copies
Of Zork but can't read them at all.

A two-headed priest in Albania
(Who's completely insane in both crania)
Thinks his body is host
To a villainous ghost.
His complaint? Cacodemonomania.

A debutante (call her a deb)
Has just entered society's web.
In the socialite whirl,
She's no longer a girl,
And in time may become a celeb.

The exequy (funeral rite)
Was scheduled for last Wednesday night.
His remains (now he's dead)
O'er his birth state were spread
By a Spad — like he flew  in our flight.

With a body to stop any boy
And a sensual purr, she's a joy.
Her voluptuous line
Will be hot in '09—
She's the auto you oughta employ.

Number four in the alphabet's D.
It starts doctor and duke, as we see.
It is found on rear bars
Of German-owned cars
And precedes number five, which is E.

"I see Harry's not here again. Why?
You seemed happy. Have things gone awry?"
"Yes my life's really changed.
We've split up. We're estranged.
Live apart now. It looks like goodbye."

Every heresy we try to deter.
If a nun, for example, should stir
Theological scandal,
We've bell, book and candle
With which we'll excommunicate her.

In the cattywhompus house that I built,
A mad architect's marbles were spilt.
It was based on the bevel
Instead of the level —
Chaotic and skewed, with a tilt.

The jackpot is mine — ain't it funny!
Life will change, and the future looks sunny!
Folks felicitate me
And applaud, but — oh, gee! —
What they're after, I fear, is my money.

Epicritic: such nerves can assess
Tiny pressure change. Add s-i-s;
t-i-c gets the flick—
Epicrisis: "when sick,
It's a secondary crisis." Oh? Yes.

A bedboard has virtues emphatical
For people with twinges sciatical.
Something solid instead
Of a soft, downy bed
Has a healing effect, enigmatical.

Dr. Atkins espoused a new diet
So popular thousands would try it.
Carbohydrates? No way!
And yet fats are OK.
As for me, I still say I don't buy it.

The things kids get up to today
Go beyond simple mischief at play.
Now they hack main computers
And fire grown ups' shooters;
We'd scrump pears, but real stealing? No way!

My new job's at a radio station.
I forgot its identification —
The call letters.  Groaned
My stern boss when I phoned,
"I am texting you that information."

Daisy Cow heard a cowherd was hired
Since the previous cowherd was fired
For (A) being lazy
And (B) driving Daisy
To fences electrically wired.

Poor Johnny has only one arm,
Since a firework caused him great harm.
As I understand,
It went off in his hand —
Lost his farmhand job down at the farm.

Sir Christopher Codrington came
To Antigua, with sugar his aim,
Using slaves in pursuit
Of this ill-gotten loot.
His successors shed slavery's shame.

My considered opinion I'll utter, by
Your leave, on the insect called butterfly.
It appears thus to me,
And I hope you'll agree:
A more suitable name would be flutterby.

In Greenwich, the timekeeper powers
The clock generator, then showers.
His work doesn't end
'Til he meets with a friend
At the club they attend after hours.

This really could be quite a lark,
Limericizing aardvark.
Though the rhyme is infernal,
The mammal's nocturnal.
(It only comes out after dark.)

The monarch, by royal decree,
Fills her minions with maximal glee
With this birthday backhander
Of Empire's Commander
(That's British), i.e. C.B.E.

He asked me to be his co-regent.
To be honest, I'm not his allegiant.
He's a nettlesome master—
A prickly disaster.
His crest? It's a porcupine sejant.

What has finitude?  Something that's bounded,
Like a fortress enclosed and surrounded.
But my love for you, dear,
Isn't finite, that's clear;
It keeps growing like interest compounded.

In the office I'm sitting and lurking,
So that others will think that I'm working.
But to fudgel I try,
In a manner that's sly,
For in fact all I'm doing is shirking.

The mob's shouting down his denial,
Their outburst disrupting the trial.
His lawyer, now fearing
He's losing his hearing,
Shuts his ears to the noisy decrial.

"I'm no rat," said the girl, "I won't tell!"
Now the debutante's locked in a cell.
To pursue their objectives,
A team of detectives
Interrogate — wringing the belle.

On the stage, her translucent camise,
Loose and breezy, seemed certain to please;
But sans camisole under it,
It's surely no wonder it
Was caught in a censorship freeze.

Minor problems crept onto our plate,
But they went unaddressed till too late.
When we started to care,
They were too much to bear,
And a thousand-cut death was our fate.

Some folks might think cranberry glass
Is for fruit of the cranberry class.
But it's glass of deep red,
With a gold sheen, and said
To be sought by the English top brass.

I put bundles of notes on the nose
Of that nag, but he fell. I suppose
I'm demoralised, yet
I could win if I bet
One more time. (That's an uplifting close.)

Men are butchering folks in the night
With machetes that slice left and right.
Pools of red on the floor
Are now clotting—the gore
Of this bloodbath's a sickening sight.

"We are finally done here. Let's blow!"
But disaster—the car would not go!
"Like John Doe," observed Ted,
"Our damn DieHard is dead."
"That's just great! Someone call for a tow."

A remarkable thing is the bed:
It's a place you can sleep, rest your head,
Or entwine with your lover.
If pine forms the cover,
It probably means that you're dead.

Campanulate: "shaped like a bell"
(Be it pepper or flower or shell).
At a camp I attended,
Each afternoon ended
With dinner bell rings and a yell.

These two paintings are hinged, like a book.
On the altar they stand (need no hook).
They relate to each other,
Like sister and brother.
For balance, give each a good look.

An elogist finds the apt phrase
In a song or a poem of praise
That he loudly proclaims—
A pronouncement that aims
To amaze and set passions ablaze.

The songs of this folk-hero singer,
A pied piper of sorts, a real zinger,
Broadened music and minds
And addressed many kinds
Of large issues: Bob Dylan, humdinger!

The easiest targets for hitting
Are those without arms.  Thus, it's fitting
A sacrosanct right
Lets us put up a fight.
Without weapons, we're ducks who are sitting.

Just Frankie, Annette, surf and sand—
Boy, those beach party movies were bland!
In those innocent days
Frankie crooned, caught some rays;
A teen idol who sang and got tanned.

Want to fly, really cheap, through the sky?
Then the airline to try's bmi.
For the cheapest fares, maybe,
It's bmi baby.
Pack a lunch, or more charges apply.

I expurgate content too raw,
Like a pup in a crocodile's maw.
I redact the indecent;
The worst of the recent
Involved what a pedophile saw.

A soldier who's airborne will jump
From a plane and come down with a thump.
Then he'll brush off his rump,
Grab his gear and then hump
'Til he bumps off some enemy chump.

The equestrians came out in force
When the Pony Express laid its course.
No criers were needed
With riders ensteeded;
Down the trail came the mailmen ahorse.

You are done here; you simply can't hack it.
So, relinquish your black Eton jacket.
You'd be only a phony in
Square-cut Etonian
Garb. Get your suitcase and pack it.

One more lodgepole stacked up in a deck—
Men at work keeping nature in check.
Lumber fresh from the felling
Is not as compelling.
See it all without craning your neck.

If transmitting your audio far,
Get an amp with good CMRR.
If there's noise on the line,
Then your signal's still fine
If it's balanced (that's equal; on par).

If leprosy mars your physique,
There's a treatment that lasts a whole week:
Acedapsone is strong
And its potency's long—
Just get a big shot in each cheek.

Dad's sister's produced quite a brood:
Nine children in twelve years accrued.
Poor auntie's biotic
Production's chaotic.
My uncle she should have eschewed.

Your windows need cleaning, I fear!
Use a chammy—they'll shine bright and clear.
It's not made from chamois?
I don't give a damn, moi,
It works whether sheepskin or deer.

The bandits (folks called them "banditos")
Stole platters of pork cuchifritos;
Thus their dinner was hot.
They consumed quite a lot,
Though they much preferred spicy burritos.

A wild group of cats (that's a clowder)
Got into my low-fat milk powder.
They were feral, it's true,
But they made a good stew.
(And the leftovers made a good chowder!)

So brief is my span of attention,
I can't track things from mention to mention,
And what seems to be new
Is but true dé—wait, who
Are—Hey, pamphlets on fire prevention!

Eurasia's divided in two
By the wide Dardanelles, which cuts through
Where the Brits battled Turks,
And attacked Turkish works,
But the Brits, in defeat, all withdrew.

Since he heard I was into cross-dating,
My girlfriend's big brother's been waiting.
Archeologically sound,
A site's age can be found
Using similar sites and equating.

My filters should block them, but nay!
Spam emails beset me each day,
Pushing stock tips, nude boys,
Drugs for sex, naughty toys—
All ad nauseam. Please, go away!

An explicator's one who takes pains
To make plain.  Thus she clearly explains:
Makes complexity sensible,
The arcane comprehensible,
And from jargon and argot refrains.

Godiva sat tall on her mare
As she rode through the streets on a dare.
She'd no shift or chemise,
Her hair flew in the breeze,
But the lady, herself, was all there!

This old man claims to speak Faeroese—
His assertion engenders unease,
For it has to be said
That the pharaohs are dead,
And their language has few devotees.

Your Highness, this crime was most heinous.
This crook stole a statue of Janus
From the castle's front door,
And he claims, what is more,
It belongs in a crypt on Uranus.

Whenever I eat guacamole,
I savor the taste very slowly.
I'm a true avocado
Aficionado—
To me other foods seem unholy.

The word daylight means "daytime" or "dawn"
(When, in sleep deprivation, I yawn).
In the plural form, it's
A slang term for "one's wits."
If you're scared out of daylights, they're gone.

"If we ever had sex, what a banner
Day that would be!"  Joy, in a manner
Direct, warned, "I flat out
Refuse, so get that out
Of your head."  In my bed, I won't plan her.

"My plant's called enchanter's (yes) nightshade,
And bears blossoms," I read,  "of a light shade."
"Not just light, they're pure white,"
Mom opined. "Quite a sight.
For your bridesmaids, precisely the right shade!"

He went out with a jellyfish (blubber),
But was too narcissistic to rub her
On her ridge adumbrellar;
So selfish a feller
Would use a medusa, then snub her.

To make my small software biz grow,
I solve, to find where fluids flow,
Differential equations
On many occasions.
Expensive experiments? No!

The affectionate gesture I miss
Is your tender, slow butterfly kiss.
It melts me like butter
When eyelashes flutter
On mine, or my skin — it is bliss.

Bring it on!  We will never be cowed.
We'll stay standing resilient and proud.
Are we up for a fight
Against evil?  Damn right!
Terror simply will not be allowed.

Suicidal, depressed, in a stupor,
Raving, often insane, William Cowper,
In spite of this curse
Wrote original verse:
He was super, but never a duper.

If traveling makes you a wreck
Avoid an antipodal trek
To the opposite end
Of the earth — and why wend
Your way there when you'd rather rent Shrek?

Know what Ann reads while getting dialysis?
She's devoted to Fourier analysis!
Me, I try to avoid all
Kinds of waves sinusoidal,
Else my brain gets harmonic paralysis.

Cyclothymic—that's Pete's personality.
Sad or manic, there's seldom neutrality
In his changeable moods—
He enthuses, then broods.
Guess that's Peter's bipolar mentality.

Not finding the words to profess
The meaning he needs to impress,
The chirologist will
Use hand signs with skill,
Conveying what words can't express.

The term Bauerwurst sausage portrays
A tautologous noun-phrase malaise,
Because sausage translates
Into Wurst. How that grates!
Tautological crime never pays.

An asylum is where I remain
Les docteurs check for l'eau on my brain.
Seems they put me away,
'Cause in Paris, they say,
When you jump off a bridge you're in Seine.

To get onto the freeway, I'll take
The new access road here, once I make
This right turn.  But, oh, hey—
What's this sign say? WRONG WAY?
Golly, maybe I've made a mistake…

Here's a word that's both odd and worthwhile:
To clapperclaw—"scold" or "revile."
It is also "to claw."
I revere it with awe,
As it makes me both tremble and smile.

Beware the bombora, my boy.
'Neath the surf, the sea seethes. Reef ahoy!
Those big breakers can kill,
But oh man, what a thrill,
And oh boy, the ride's pure gnarly joy.

Deadpan comics, to me, are the best.
I can't tell you how much I'm impressed
When they joke all the while
Without cracking a smile.
That's the way to deliver a jest!

They rolled out the malls near the city,
All so similar, stores sitting pretty,
Their designs cookie-cutter.
Mom-and-Pop shops could utter
Complaints—financiers had no pity.

There are markets left open to fill.
If we fail to expand, others will.
(I'll admit that I'm hopin'
For my post they'll open
A branch office down in Brazil.)

If you drink way too much, and too quick,
Then you're likely to get very sick
 (Goes down smooth from a cup,
 But less so coming up);
Ah, that's alcohol poisoning's trick.

The e-mail has bounced from my blast
To the mailing list I have amassed.
Did each friend of mine change
His address? That is strange!
Don't my pals want to MAKE MONEY FAST!!!!! ?

A detractor's base sneer you'd erase,
And you long to make clear his disgrace?
If your tongue won't express
Your disdain and distress,
Turn your back with a sharp about-face.

Collegiate athletics include
Gymnastics and football, but, dude,
We're going to school
For sports that are cool,
Like keg stands performed in the nude.

And here's Beatrice, as sharp as she's pretty:
She's fire-tongued and merry and witty.
She welcomes the guests —
But to one, though she jests,
She serves nothing but scorn and harsh pity.

The Balkans refers to some nations
(Example: the one for Croatians);
Division and strife
Are a part of their life—
As are frequent renationalizations.

Are rhinos who cry labelled crinose?
Or is crinose, like my nose, a dry nose?
Any pro, I suppose,
Might propose that he knows
It's what grows on the noses of rhinos.

Not a class in intestinal gas
Or the science of gut-noise, alas,
Borborology's talk
That is dirty. I walk
Straight away from its filthy morass.

I'm a footballer: I kick a ball,
Or I head it (no hands), but may fall
As I run on the pitch
Of this outdoor game, which,
As the beautiful game, has it all!

When my mohawk was put to the test,
I was three inches taller (at best).
Although still pretty small,
Lots of people would call:
"Oh my god! Is that Brent? He's accresced!"

In my Halloween Graveyard of Doom,
I've constructed a large haunted tomb,
And in front, in a pot,
Is a big bloody clot
That is technically known as a grume.

Chari-Nile—seems these languages span
Parts of Africa (Kenya, Sudan)
Near the sandy Sahara.
They're not in Bukhara,
And certainly not in Japan.

The Beatles were modern and smart.
Their great albums had feeling and heart.
Add A Hard to Day's Night,
You have one from the height
Of their fame. It topped many a chart.

When we're staffing, we aim for the mean:
Central casting types—standard, routine—
Not too smart or too hairy.
Atypical's scary.
An orange is orange, not green.

Dudley Moore played the drunk to the letter,
And Minnelli was great, but forget her.
It was Hobson (John Gielgud)
Who caused Arthur to feel good.
No butler will ever be better.

Old man Stokes seems unusually dense.
Folks make jokes at this elder's expense.
Though an old-timer, he
Claims he's just twenty-three,
Speaking dotardly—making no sense.

Before I set off on the trek,
My gear was laid out on the deck.
"Have I got the right map?
And my BLT wrap?
And my red leather thong?" "Check, check, check."

And a very warm welcome to you.
Check our mates, we're a chess playing crew.
Rook and bishop and queen
Or a knight in between
STICk around on the board. Join the queue!

The oracle uttered words cryptic
That turned out to be apodictic.
It perhaps spared them woe
That the seekers not know
They were duped by a message elliptic.

I went bankrupt, but don't ask me how.
I was broke, and flat busted, but now
All my debits are void;
Those I owe are annoyed.
Ain't it great what the law will allow?

Your visage? Astounding! And so
I must avert eyes or I'll go
As blind as a bat,
For your beauty's such that
Mortal men can not look on you—Oh!

At the start of the parliament's year,
A ballot gives backbenchers cheer.
Those who win may then bring
Up a bill on their 'thing'.
It's a chance to define their career.

Fire was under control (so we thought),
Ah, but then things went sideways; they fought
Through the night; sought to save
People's homes; they were brave:
But, oh, what destruction was wrought!

Many natives of India buck
As they ride in a taxi or truck.
Are they bouncing around?
No, they're talking, I've found
(Though at Hindi I totally suck).

See that eagle-eyed cly-faker ogle
The breast of the newspaper mogul,
From whose pocket there pokes
A silk handkerchief? Folks,
I predict that to come is that fogle.

Leaving lands where one church was trustee
For all souls, they said, "Let us agree.
No one denomination
Shall hold our salvation:
All beliefs (even dis-) shall be free."

The other team's skip, crouching low,
Sent his stone down the ice, smooth and slow,
And my shot rock was clipped;
From the house it then slipped.
That fine chip shot delivered a blow.

When speaking of plants, effloresce
(That's to flower, to bloom) might impress.
But the chances are high
Normal folk will decry
Your pedantical talk nonetheless.

A coverchief covered one's head
In Chaucerian times, so I've read.
It's an obsolete word
That is no longer heard,
Since today we use kerchief instead.

It's the worst kind of repatriation
In a body bag, back to your nation—
Shot to bits by your mate,
'Cause he just couldn't wait,
In a sad blue on blue situation.

An assagai (African spear)
May be used on a man or a deer.
In the first case: arrest.
In the second, at best,
A roast venison soon will appear.

Cousin Claire took a job that is clerical;
She has talent in matters numerical.
"Her spherical writing,"
Said her boss, "is exciting.
I love any gal who's dexterical!"

Where purposeless words may be stated
Or writing's pretentious, inflated,
That's fustian named;
Like a heavy cloth famed
As a padding—coarse, stout, heavy-weighted.

I autograph books at a signing
On the endpaper fixed to the lining,
'Cause the endpaper's sturdy.
My notes have grown wordy.
I've time, lately; sales are declining.

I'm a victim of clickjacking, tricked
Into visiting sites I've not picked.
What a sneaky idea!
You get somewhere via
A button you don't know you've clicked.

"Pomoxis, your opercle's spiny."
"You human, I'd say, 'Bite my hiney,'
Except that you would."
"Sure! You taste yummy good —
You're a crappie. Now, don't be so whiney."

HELP WANTED: Two men with a cage
For a death match we're planning to stage.
It's the fight of your lives:
One succumbs, one survives.
(We're prepared to pay minimum wage.)

Both his friends and his enemies say
That he never does something half way,
And this trait—his extremeness—
He considers supremeness.
He's smugness itself on display.

The president's speaking, so hush.
His exaugural speech — it's to blush!
He is leaving his post
And we'll give him the most
Uninhibited outgoing flush.

A marvelous mammal's the beaver,
And, oh, what an overachiever!
This builder of dams
Fills the river with jams,
And its name means . . . a hat or a Cleaver.

The dog days of summer are here,
And I'm perfectly Sirius, dear,
When I say that in August,
The days are their doggest,
While I'm catatonic, I fear.

I simply could never abide¹
To abide² in the place I abide³.
So, I've left my abode
And set off on the road.
If you see me, please give me a ride.

When a kid is confined after class
 Or a crate's stopped in Customs, alas,
 It is just a convention
 That is known as detention.
Keep your cool, for it surely will pass.

When the 50 Foot Woman attacks,
You'll need popcorn and sodas and snacks.
See the giantess doom
Her philandering groom!
See the absence of 30-foot slacks!

Cablinasians are people betwixt
Many races; no single one's fixed.
They have Indian, Asian,
A trace of Caucasian,
And African ancestry mixed.

Miss Oyl is my goil, when on shore,
As her body's so hard to ignore.
You can feel the sensuality
Of ideal cylindricality:
Twenty-four twenty-four twenty-four.

The evidence shows you're convictable,
And your sentence appears most predictable
For taking the life
Of your innocent wife
Whose neck was so soft and constrictable.

I've got to get something for Jean
For her birthday next week. She is keen
On receiving a ring,
I well know. Here's the thing:
She'll be getting a washing machine.

Jake got caught with those hubcaps he steals.
Now he sits in jail cooling his heels—
Not the best of careers.
He'll serve one to two years,
'Less his lawyer can file some appeals.

We worship in churches, I've read,
'Cos religions are mostly man-led.
But if women held sway
We would probably pray
In sanctified shoe shops instead.

Now, the closed sink is not hard to do;
You just push the point down and then through.
A professional tip:
If the paper should rip,
Just remember you always have glue...

When Chief Jimmy McPhelps goes to hunt
In the Highlands, you'll hear the man grunt,
As he's old, and he's wide,
But his gillie will stride
Alongside him, or guide from up front.

Though archaic and obsolete, blysne
Nonetheless needs its own definition.
And though I'll opine
That this verse does not shine —
The word does, as it simply means "glisten".

No display of engaging verbosity
Could portray my innate fabulosity.
I spin yarns; I'm Joe Cool;
Also blond; but a fool?
You say "thick", but I call it viscosity.

Went to London and smoked my whole stash.
Wrote a cheque to myself to get cash.
Brought it down to the bank;
Asked a teller named Frank,
"Can I get my encashment in hash?"

It seems that the news isn't changing —
There are scandals and killings, far-ranging.
The stuff that I'm reading
Is quickly proceeding
To prove itself wholly estranging.

Give me more! Give me more! Give me more!
I will always want more than before!
All that glistens is gold,
Which I'll have and behold —
Greed is good, yes, and business is war!

This argument's dragged on too long.
I have stated my case and it's strong.
Can't you see what I'd do
By agreeing with you?
I'd quite simply make both of us wrong.

Every evening 'e powders 'is wig.
'Is waistcoat's brass buttons are big
An' so shiny'n'bright. 'E
Is quite 'igh'n'mighty.
'E's doin' it up in good twig.

At the moment, I should be at work,
But instead, I'm just having a shirk,
Because limerick writing
I find more exciting.
(The wife finds out, she'll go berserk!)

This is birth control, barrier style:
Use a small latex cup — and a smile.
Though its use is a snap,
Is the cervical cap
With its ten-percent failure worthwhile?

Here's a Droodle, part riddle/part doodle
(I collect them. I've got a caboodle!):
In a circle are spots
In a group, lots and lots.
One's apart, though. What gives? Use your noodle!

Got two coins for my birthday from Noah;
A hundred would make one balboa.
These centesimos are
Of less value by far
Than a dozen or so protozoa.

"See that: Emil, asleep, peels a lime",
Snarky Syd sneered: "Can't palindromes rhyme?
No. Mel, asleep, peels a lemon
(In Yemen or Bremen?)"
Such divine to-and-fro is no crime.

The king had three daughters in trot.
One's a bitch, one's a slut, one is hot.
Tom ogled each leeringly
Then panned them all searingly,
"Cordelia's the best of the lot."

In the hallways, my monitor duties
I ably performed, despite cuties
Who steamed up my glasses
While begging for passes
And left me with cases of cooties.

This limerick earned stellar reviews.
Steven Spielberg says, "This I can use!"
In the musical, he
Says Brad Pitt will play me.
All in all, this is very good news!

On a long wooden plank made for girls,
As a man pirouettes, flips and whirls,
A 5.8 quake
Makes the balance beam shake:
And he slips down spread-eagle, and hurls.

Tom's swift mount lacked a thoroughbred's grace.
At the track he seemed quite out of place.
Crude jockeys cursed coarsely,
But Tom countered hoarsely,
"My steed will indeed win the race."

"March on Richmond now, General McDowell,"
His staff heard old Honest Abe growl.
"Get your troops on the go;
This war's going too slow.
At Bull Run, make Secessionists howl."

September: the foliage blushes —
Is tinted with fiery flushes.
The sunshine is patchy;
The breezes are catchy:
They swirl in their snatches and rushes.

Abney levels: surveyors' best hope
Of measuring angles of slope
Between points A and B —
Say, from here to that tree —
Without using long pieces of rope.

The Met opera singer Dwayne Croft
Caught a cold, so he sneezed and he coughed.
He was sent home to bed.
Doctor said, "Rest your head
On a cushiony spot—one that's soft."

I bought a new chopper last night;
Had to bury the old one from sight.
Seems the neighbor cat's missing
With his yowling and hissing—
He put up a mighty good fight.

What is data? A bundling of facts—
Joined in tables, or pie graphs, or tracts,
Or in lists—a collection,
Awaiting inspection.
Then insight, from facts, one extracts.

Autocannibalism: you eat
Some parts of your body. It's meat.
Like your butt or your belly.
You think this is smelly?
Some cannibals think this is neat.

When the dentist's located the pain,
The root tip's excised, with procaine.
Not my favourite way
Of spending a day;
Apicectomy: never again!

With a term-load  of research to read,
Buy the coursepacks; they're all you will need.
They beat dragging around;
They're excerpted and bound,
And the whole ball of wax — guaranteed.

Flights of stairs with a turn like a vee
And no well, but a landing, would be
A quite aptly named spot
For a pooch to be caught;
Both are dog-legged. One's taking a pee.

I'm willing to make a prediction:
My stepsister's vivid depiction
Of the guy she selected—
"Adonis perfected"—
Is a work of ridiculous fiction!

Caenolestes, a genus of shrew
(Rat) opossums, is found from Peru
To the north in los Andes.
My tío Fernández
Tries taming these "shrews" in his zoo.

On the train, the conductor was spruce
In her outfit of navy and puce.
She was small in the breast,
With a flatcar-shaped chest,
But she had a colossal caboose.

In business, here's how to advance:
Gain a foothold first — get a firm stance,
Then seduce those above;
No, it isn't for love —
Make them pay to get into your pants.

A burglar in Rome filled his bag
With a surfeit of silvery swag.
"All the aurum's a bore,
But I simply adore
The argentum (in shorter form, Ag)."

Does your date get irate, raise a clamor,
When you make a mistake in your grammar?
Does he rail; does he rant
When you rhyme aunt with ant?
Such a trait, I would state, bates his glamor.

"Now it's CJ?" she asked. "'Member me?"
A long pause.  Then he spoke.  "Don't you see?
Though I don't hold a grudge,
Still, I'm now the chief judge—
Please appeal somewhere else, rumor-free."

What's meant by catastrophonical?
It's being both phallic and yonical.
It's a circular square
Or an atheist's prayer;
It means nothing: the question's ironical.

A girl who was pregnant, not due,
Could not wait for her baby's debut.
So a surgeon was called
And a window installed,
Thus creating a womb with a view.

Why is it that limericks flow
If the topic's decidedly low?
It takes little to coax
Scatological jokes;
Nasty anapests seem apropos.

All the drakes feel the urge to show pluck.
Into colourful fights they get stuck.
In the spring, when they're fond
Of romance on the pond,
Every male, win or lose, 'scores a duck'.

From the opening scene this film's gushy.
The plot is romantic and mushy.
There's a girl and her boy,
And a coy ex boy toy.
Just like all sappy chick flicks it's slushy.

Jim's a sycophant, full of deceit;
All his praises are lies, false but sweet.
All his bosses, moronic,
Believe this gnathonic,
Slick, phoney, baloney-full cheat.

The Yuletide brought old Mr. Peck out
With visions of rooms he would deck out,
But with prices so high,
He dropped dead with a sigh,
Checking out with his check out at checkout.

"Where's my satchel?  It's gone with no trace?"
Perry Mason has such a long face!
This superb legal mind
Is dejected to find
He's apparently lost his first case.

I'm in pain every month without fail,
And I'm leaving a bloody red trail;
I just don't wanna see ya
With dysmenorrhœia.
Next week you can get some more tail.

Focalize:  This is a word
That you heretofore may not have heard.
It means simply "to focus
On one certain locus."
Why not just say focus?  Absurd!

It's the hype that you hear in advance,
Or deposits you see when you glance
At the sink or the tub.
Get a sponge, now, and scrub.
Will the buildup all vanish? Fat chance!

There is one thing that I, a strange guy, like:
Abstract art with designs that are eyelike.
Eyes not wearing a frown,
And not black and not brown —
Happy eyes that are colored blue-sky-like.

Six bottles are all I can belt down.
My date was a mess and I felt down.
So I came to the bar,
And downed jar after jar;
Another? I thing I will melt down.

"I've got belonephobia," said Tony,
"And I swear that my fear isn't phony!"
This odd word, it appears,
Means it's needles he fears.
It just looks like he's scared of baloney.

When we blabber for far too much time
(Such as limericists might do in rhyme),
Those who listen grow violent
And scream out, "Be silent!
Pretend you're a monk or a mime!"

I'm a person who's really excited
By gadgets, and really farsighted.
I'll often pursue
All the things they can do,
With my gadgeteer's calling delighted.

Like a cheap knock-off purse from the mall,
You've become, my dear, dull and banal.
It appears there is not
An original thought
In your head, so please — don't speak at all.

Behind the sun, where we can't scan it,
There's a strange hypothetical planet.
Antichthon, it's called,
And you might be appalled
When you learn that Australians man it!

Said sad Eve, "Ad, I'm grieved! We're directed
To leave! God's aggrieved! We're infected
With sin!" So they went,
Thus disparadised, sent.
Eden's stamp on their visa:  REJECTED.

"The Sharks say they're ready to rumble?
We'll make all those losers look humble!"
"Omna reddy tuh fie.
Mebby summudder nie."
"What the hell are you saying? Don't drumble!"

"Look after your vessels aortic,"
I said to my friend astronautic.
"It's not a great place
For a heart attack, space.
One giant leap—POW! Rigor mortic."

There are those who go fishing by night
For mere perch, with a flare for a light.
When you fish for the barse
You just sit on your arse
And you wait for the bastard to bite.

Though condemned to support the whole Earth
Upon shoulders of heavenly worth,
Atlas bore the world's weight—
Gave his name through his fate—
To books mapping the planet's great girth.

An account manager: Sarah's job means
All the clients who buy their machines
From her firm for theirs
Will find business affairs
Are addressed at events she convenes.

The new prof, here a year, won't be staying.
The chairman delayed his okaying.
He was rated, belatedly:
"He speaks complicatedly,
And nobody knows what he's saying."

Of the AM band I'm a big fan,
And I listen whenever I can.
It's the amplitude (height)
You must modulate right
To make practical radio, man.

At a mathematician's abode,
I had dinner—the food overflowed.
Seven courses to eat,
With the last one a sweet:
For dessert, I ate pi à la mode.

I'm an esper. Though destiny's kittle,
I can scry future crises a little.
The good news: it's not
What you think. But the plot
Has a twist, and you're caught in the middle.

I'm an acting temp this or temp that:
A great pinch-hitter coming to bat
For a boss who is gone.
When that's done, I move on —
Sadly, backwards to where I was at.

My doc says I'd best not eat beef.
This news brings me trouble and grief.
I'm afraid that this diet'll
Feed my disquietal.
Bummer! Bad luck! No relief!

"God's forgiveness is nearly consumed.
All are sinners," our minister fumed.
"But we few know the way
To survive the dark day.
Present parties excepted, we're doomed."

Jenny jumped on a chair and cried, "Eek!"
At the sound of a tiny mouse squeak.
She'd been programmed that way.
I remarked, "How cliché!
Why not have it for lunch—be unique!"

Canadian Thanksgiving — so quirky:
Harvest festival, or a faux turkey?
Did the Pilgrims first land
On Acadia's strand?
There's no meat in that myth, just tofurkey.

Jolly chippies were awesome to hear
In the '80s, when hard discs were dear.
Floppy discs couldn't hack
Pre-made sounds to play back;
Real-time chiptunes are gone though, I fear.

That boy, on his bike, never meant
To collide with my car—but he went
By too close.  Now I'm screaming,
For what was once gleaming,
Now carries a big ugly dent.

Dianetics, by Hubbard, L. Ron,
Is life-saving — or just a swell con?
"Buy my books!" But beware,
Now the cupboard is bare,
And our hard-earned life savings? Hell, gone.

The adjustable wrench, I revere.
It's so easy to set, mummy dear.
That's ironic.  Your face
Has just emptied the place:
"Bag of spanners" is not even near.

A big snake has me wrapped in its grasp.
(Take a guess — anaconda or asp?)
It's my life's latest hurdle —
I can't disengirdle
My body. There goes my last ga—

Ephor Chilon was Greek and a sage,
And his sayings still leap off the page:
Don't speak ill of the dead;
Curb your anger, he said,
Obey laws; be respectful of age.

If God would remove all the hues
And discolorize Earth, then I'd lose
Stunning sunsets and scenery,
Garden-grown greenery—
All I'd be left with? The blues.

Last weekend when we were together
You asked for a poem about feather.
This is it!  See those things
That comprise a bird's wings?
They're for tickling dark regions (yours, nether).

"This mammoth I'm holding," he cried,
"I've been folding from elephant hide.
No, not pachyderm skin,
It's a foldably thin
Sturdy paper — no elephants died."

Little pigs, musketeers, Dixie Chicks,
Fountain coins, the front court of the Knicks
Come in 3's—as do these:
Wise men, blind mice, and peas,
Charlie's Angels (hot girls who were dicks).

It expresses impressive success,
When it's idiomatic, unless
It's a word that's concerning
The pyro who's burning
A structure that farmers possess.

A cross-eyed old woman named Rose
Seems to stare at the end of her nose.
With this ocular trouble,
She always sees double,
So she calls her poor husband "the Joes."

Mom and Uncle Raoul are ashamed
Of the outrage with which they've been blamed.
Uncle's brother, Young Fred,
Caught the couple in bed.
"Cutleaved coneflower!" Daddy exclaimed.

Amarelle: an unusual cherry.
It's so pale and so sour that it's scary.
It can only produce
Rather colorless juice
(Though the depth of its clearness may vary).

When you make an arrangement and feel
That it's honestly handled, the seal
Of approval's assured
And the outcome's secured
Since all's kept above board in the deal.

There's an ad exec, Peter LaPount,
Who's in charge of the Hitler account.
Harvey Hitler makes shoes
That he wants to sell Jews,
Quite a problem for Pete to surmount.

Why pursue the ideal illustration?
Use Corbis, avoid litigation.
They've bought digital rights
To some millions of sights—
One more lucrative Bill Gates creation.

When the sun sets, the sky becomes pink.
The beautiful scene makes me think
Of the long night ahead,
Watching reruns in bed,
So I have my acronychal drink.	

"For swimming the backstroke," said Fred,
"Float face up like you're lying in bed.
Flip your feet up and down
While you try not to drown,
As you windmill your arms past your head."

I stopped shaving, and just as I feared,
A profusion of whiskers appeared.
It looks so out of place
On my baby-like face,
Such a wooly (or flocculent) beard!

That couple's bemoaning their luck,
Having trouble becoming unstuck.
Though uncommonly supple,
They cannot uncouple
(His cab from the back of her truck).

This botanical class is for laymen.
Part one: it's the male part we're namin'.
It's protruding — exserted —
Now don't be perverted!
Let's say it together: "the stamen."

I told a dessert chef named Jake,
"I just love that Pavlova you make."
I then asked, "Is it easy
To make?"  "Easy breezy.
A cakewalk," he said, "piece of cake."

A person who darkens your door
Might be smelly, a pain, or a bore,
So you're dreading their visit—
Our turn again, is it?
Let's tell them we've left for the shore—
For a couple of months, maybe more.
Pretend that we've moved to Mysore.
Do you know what a Doberman's for?
Entertaining your aunt is a chore;
I believe that she's starting to snore.
We could claim that we're busy at 4:00.
God, those pollsters are hard to ignore!
They won't know that we're home any more
If we darken the light near the door.

There once was a time when a Sunday
Was God's day, and lived as the one day
We classed as dominical.
Now folks, I'm not cynical,
But sad it's become just a fun day!

It's making me whine, fume and fret—
I'm totally mad and upset.
I have moved out of range—
Broadcast area change—
My station can't reach me here yet.

In mid-state Indiana you'll find
BSU has the best things in mind
To help you meet your whole
Educational goal
If to excellence you are inclined.

Having excellence means one's outstanding,
Just like excellency. Now I'm expanding
This list—one more word:
Yes, Your Excellency's heard
When one speaks to a guy who's commanding.

"She's got breathiness," said the director;
He was ready just then to select her.
"She has breathlessness?" Mel
Didn't hear very well
And demanded the boss man reject her.

If you're manic and out of control,
And your life's like a bottomless hole,
Then a camisole's arms
May protect you from harms
While your medicine works toward its goal.

A flame war broke out in the forum.
The insults?  I tried to ignore 'em.
Provoking in rude
Escalation, a dude
Drove me likewise to trashing decorum.

I contend that my own point of view
Is as valid as yours, though I rue
The lack of objective
Criteria, effective
For "art," showing false versus true.

The water was badly polluted
At Camelford — that's unrefuted.
The upshot (I ruminated):
My brain was aluminated,
For what I recall is disputed.

That obscurest of laureates, Cibber
Was mocked by A. Pope (the great ribber).
He was rude; he was vain,
And a bit of a pain;
And his verses, Pope said, were just gibber.

Now it's leggings embroidered with fruits,
And that hair, and those polka-dot boots—
She's all pigtails and pinks;
Don't know what that girl thinks.
Man has she got a case of the cutes!

When magicians shout, "Abracadabra!"
Odd objects, like lit candelabra,
Disappear in a puff —
Damn! I don't have enough
Valid rhymes to end off with an "-abra"!

Kate was dating a dashing dragoon,
All resplendent in vibrant maroon.
But the vain Russian count
Appeared wed to his mount
Till she bridled the horsey buffoon.

The Jaws of Life (truly, a wonder)
Is divulsive, and tears things asunder.
It leaves waste in its train,
But I oughtn't complain
As it carves up this bus that I'm under.

Two serpents, named Brendan and Brandon,
Filing lawsuits with reckless abandon,
Slithered slickly in court,
While alleging some tort,
But still lost, having no leg to stand on.

While decipherin' VLADIMIR PUTIN,
Might one learn of an asset's recruitin'?
U.S. Intel was ruffled
'Til letters got shuffled
To INVALID: I, TRUMP. No refutin'.

Bivariate analysis yields
Correlation twixt two different fields
In a system's statistics.
(Ignore the logistics!
Consider the power it wields!)

"We're not talking embroidery, dear."
"Nor of cute fluffy kittens, I fear."
They dismissively note
Women don't need the vote:
Some men beg to be drowned in their beer.

"There's a chance I'll attract Gabrielle."
"Ha!  Don't bet on it.  Kev, I should tell,
As your friend, that will happen
When pigs start to flappin'
Their wings.  There ain't no way in hell."

Chemical rays: beams of light
At the end of the spectrum which might,
On a plate photographic,
Cause chemical traffic,
Making silver from salts they excite.

The horizon's renewed pinkish cast —
Gentle tinge — shows that darkness is past.
If the dawn's not forsaken,
The sky will awaken.
We'll see how long daylight will last.

The fellow who had the temerity
To disregard break or disparity,
And write disconnect down
As a newly coined noun
Will be savaged, I trust, by posterity.

On TV was the place they found fame,
Though we note, they don't share the same name.
But I know you won't quibble,
Thwarting Hall, and then Dibble,
We find Bilko and Top Cat the same.

Sir Oliver Pilkington-Pie
Sailed the seas to the Isle of Skye.
The ship that he cruised on
He naturally boozed on
And drank every last barrel dry.

Since I've hit twenty limericks now,
Chris J. Strolin saw fit to allow
Me to workshop and edit.
He sure did me credit!
That adjutancy's fun, huh?  And how!

A caliphal state wants to free ya —
Man-made laws are replaced by Sha'ria.
They're god-given instead,
And can cost you your head —
No recourse in Islam, mamma mia!

A bind is a timber that's tied
To keep others in place, on the side
Of a boat, so it floats;
Or it floats above notes
When from one to the other you glide.

There are little black ants everywhere
In the garden, and sugar's their fare,
Where they live with their queen.
Keep your home sparkling clean,
And they'll stay with their cows in their lair.

Though the typewriter concept is stale,
They're still useful for some types of mail.
To ensure labels flatten
And stay 'gainst the platen,
Remember to flip down the bail.

Cavalierly, my miniature poodle
Would disport and cavort and canoodle
With my bitch King Charles spaniel.
The dog breeding manual
Says who will ensue's a cavoodle.

Paula's poetry's lacking congruity.
Line-to-line, there is no continuity.
In line one she has comets;
Line two: why she vomits;
Line three: her acoustic acuity.

He admits, in his youth he was bad,
Was banged up and did time. Now he's sad.
Though no longer that yob,
As ex-con there's no job,
For he's wrecked what the man might have had.

We've arrived at the doom that we dreaded.
And now into bloodshed we're headed!
The violent clashes
And skin-metal crashes
Are all for a tank of unleaded!

You may find my view unrealistic.
I believe the mastitis called cystic
Is a cross women bear,
Though when followed with care,
Its prognosis is quite optimistic.

Is your schnauzer in love with your collie?
Jolly England can help you, by golly:
Canine weddings—dog marriage
I'd never disparage.
But prenups? Now that would be folly.

I can vaguely remember the apse;
Is it part of cathedrals, perhaps?
My old undergrad lectures
About architectures
Too frequently turned into naps.

Who started the anti-Bush club?
Molly Ivins, the author of Shrub.
She alone had Dub's number.
She warned he'd encumber
Our nation as President Dub.

Benedictines adhere to monastic
Restrictions that some would call drastic.
In St. Benedict's Rule,
It's considered uncool
If your cincture is made of elastic.

The origin's clear, I can tell,
Of that expletive phrase bleeding hell:
Bleeding started as bloody;
But some fuddy-duddy
Thought bloody too gory to yell.

If you go to UC, you're a Bear.
I might shout, "Go, you dubb!" and you'd glare,
For U-Dub loves the Husky,
But a dubb is a dusky
Eurasian brown bear who's quite rare.

I've been searching for books up in attics.
Not dramatics—my major's dogmatics.
Though it's dogma I study,
Don't typecast me, buddy,
Among the religious fanatics.

Damned Colonials mocked us today:
Blew our armory, melted away.
Yankee Doodles won't fight,
But they're out there all right:
A provokingly guileful display.

My friend was baptised just last year
In a lake where the water was clear.
He was told, "The Lord frees us;
So did you see Jesus?"
"No," he said, "sure he jumped in just here?"

You've been friending too hastily, friends.
Be aware of these late-breaking trends:
Some who'd pose as your cronies,
Social media phonies,
Are but Facecrooks with villainous ends.

My neuroses are varied and deep
And include chirophobia; keep
At a distance because
The mere thought of your paws
Makes me stressed and unable to sleep.

"Who's that deep-eyed old chap in the chair?
He seems calm with no worry or care."
"That's my wife's lover, Nate.
He's deceased as of late.
Don't you love his strong smell and that stare?"

A comet's ethereal trail
Is formed by the dust in its tail.
Comet Halley you'll see
On a clear night for free
Every seventy-six years without fail.

The crone and her cronies were cackling:
"To decrepitate means 'to cause crackling.'
Throw in chemical salts
Plus some chicken fat (schmaltz).
It's a recipe well worth the tackling."

If acidophilic, you're prone
To prefer a less alkaline zone.
But your secret desire
Is something much higher:
To be Timothy Leary's first clone.

He's been gathered, he's late, that's his lot.
All his hopes and his dreams gone to pot.
He's ad patres: he's now
With his fathers. We vow,
That with re-runs, he'll not be forgot.

He's a Chewa; he lives in Malawi,
And he'll rhotacize. Out on safari,
If he shoots at a shepherd
Instead of a leopard,
He's likely to say, "Gosh, I'm sowwy!"

Absolution? Pray say that's untrue.
Don't forgive them; they know what they do.
Man is weak. All the same,
Don't deny him the blame
That he's earned. Give the devil his due.

I received a harsh ass-chewing — wow!
Got dressed down for refusing to bow
To our nasty old Queen.
Plus got banged on the bean
'Cause I snarled, "What a mean, wrinkled cow!"

Our single-voiced chants disappoint.
So, comrades, we need to anoint
A Popular Frontist
To turn contrapuntist
And write or compose counterpoint.

There are narcs who, I'm sure, will insist
That the White House drug policy list
Is correct, but I say
People don't speak that way.
Several things on that list can't exist.

Worked up to a feverish pitch,
She danced. With a flick of her switch
She pointed to those
Whom, as witches, she chose—
Abangoma, a smeller of witch.

"It's called 'cadmium orange juice,' Lynn,
Though its flavor's decidedly thin."
(Please don't tell her I've brought her
A glass of the water
I'm soaking my paint brushes in!)

My collection of posters and bills
Are all broadsides. A bookbinder's skills
Need a sheet with a fold
That his stitches can hold.
Here's the purpose a box file fulfils.

If you purchase coal tar, you're a buyer.
If you say it smells nice, you're a liar.
From its anthracene goo
Comes alizarin's hue.
If you know about that, you're a dyer.

When you're graveless (not buried), your bones
May lie scattered about, just like stones,
So whoever may stumble
Across them will grumble.
And the bones-owner's ghost? He just moans.

A database deadlock's a pain:
One process is waiting in vain
For resource that a second
Has already reckoned
It needs, hence the first cannot gain.

In acoustic aphasia, a word
(Well, its sound) can be perfectly heard,
But to understand speech
Is a task out of reach—
It sounds garbled or scrambled or blurred.

Though the birders love eagle and swift,
To the coverts they've given short shrift.
Not mere covering minions
Of second-string pinions,
They're authors of airflow and lift.

Some poets can't nail down a thought
By the end of a line, as they ought.
I get quite disappointed
With structure disjointed —
So fractured, distracted, distraught.

We'd a whole lot of folks taking naps;
The result was the Wall Street collapse.
Now we're stuck with the bill,
Which is nearly a tril.
We share blame; we elect the same saps.

A Babushka doll! What lies inside?
A Babushka doll! Crafted with pride,
More Babushka dolls still
Are discovered until
With a family of dolls you're supplied.

Bernard M. Baruch, presidential
Advisor, gave aid quite essential
To the country's finance,
Which he helped to advance.
His ideas remain consequential.

So what? So I donned the wrong hat.
Still, I'll likely catch flak about that.
It was white tie and topper,
So my homburg's improper—
More grief from the wife (the old bat).

I know a young fellow, named Bill,
Who with cyclic disorder is ill.
He's an up and down lad:
Sometimes happy, then sad.
I do hope there's a suitable pill!

I love grass—it's so luscious and green,
The most beautiful plant I have seen.
I breathe deep when I smell it;
Alas, when I sell it,
The cops aren't nearly as keen.

I'm confused a bit; what was the ground?
A strange symbol that some firms, renowned,
Use (and here's what annoys,
To denote, in alloys,
A component): Cb, rarely found.

My fiancée says all will go well
If we stick to don't ask and don't tell.
Our engagement's been great,
Though she's coming home late
Every night from the bar — what the hell?!

For this ego that I have been dealt,
Please don't gift me with necktie or belt.
But a new derby hat
Would be great; give me that,
'Cause I crave that my presents be felt.

It was rumored that Catherine the Great
Had libido mere men couldn't sate.
She died when a horse
Fell upon her. Of course,
As to who mounted whom there's debate.

She's the queen of the land, I'm the spouse,
So I'm consort—a man or a mouse?
It's a right royal pain
That it isn't my reign,
But I grin as I grumble and grouse.

"Do not stay me, I go to my Lord,
There on Holywell Hill, on the sward."
Alban parted the water
And hied to the slaughter
That added the palm to his sword.

My friend is Eurafrican, yes.
His mum is Moroccan (from Fès).
His dad's European,
A Scotsman named Ian,
Whose brother was drowned in Loch Ness.

At a fine old boutique on the Strand,
All the shopwindows (fine, old) are spanned
By a breastsummer (breast beam).
This heavy—and stressed—beam
Supports the façade (fine, old, grand).

When you stay at the Winchester Arms,
Don't let "Arms" set off any alarms.
That's no arsenal cell.
It is just a hotel
Trying hard to convey Old World charms.

"Name three stars," Teacher said with a grin,
"In the grip of the Dipper. Begin."
"First, Alkaid," said Christine.
"Next, Alcor in-between.
Then it's Alioth, closest one in."

"Atheisticalness is my trait.
There's no God who is great, merely fate!
Those indulging in prayer
Are conversing with air!"
"Die, and learn that God's there?  It's too late!"

Isn't chrematophobia funny?
You might wish this complaint on your honey,
And rejoice if your dearest
Recoiled from the merest
Suggestion of spending your money.

When the Native Americans dwelt
In the Great Plains and Eastern Woods belt,
They adopted a mode
Of new living abode
Better made than the teepee, they felt.

Half above and half under the ground,
Their old earth lodge was simple and round.
It was roofed with a dome
And provided a home
Formed from earth in the shape of a mound.

Now they all would call back when she phoned!
She was sure she had joined the beau monde
And had kissed young Prince Harry,
And proposed that they marry,
But it seems that she simply was stoned.

The dwarf elder we grow at our villa
We call bristly—oh yes!—sarsaparilla.
It has fruit that is dark
And medicinal bark.
Noxious odor? No, not a scintilla.

My plain old beef sandwich is bland,
So, a condiment's what I demand.
Add some hot English mustard;
Red-faced, I am flustered —
It's all that my taste buds can stand.

A coryzal disorder now sickens
My flock—they have mucus that thickens.
I prepare turkey soup
To get rid of their roup,
But the chickens complain like the dickens.

When the engines conked out, his command
Of the plane showed a fine, steady hand.
"Check your seat belts' condition!
Assume the position!"
He cried, "We're about to crash-land!"

You've been asked to go see an avoyer;
You surely don't want to annoy her.
It's best not to agitate
This Swiss Canton magistrate,
So always appear with your lawyer!

If a limerick's admired, it's not trite,
But regarded with awe and delight.
Such a verse becomes prized,
So I've frankly surmised
There's no way 'twould be one that I'd write.

Each morning she faces a hurdle
As Gertie squirms into her girdle,
Yet it isn't her shape
But her face (like an ape)
That will scare you and make your blood curdle.

At the party, all eyes are on Laura,
Who's dressed casual: just a fedora.
A man's hat will suffice;
Laura aims to entice,
So she sports little more than her aura.

The G-Clefs (four brothers, one friend),
Had two hits: one, "Ka-Ding Dong," they penned,
And "I Understand," one
The Four Tunes group had done;
"Auld Lang Syne" is the back-vocal blend.

A gecko once gecked at his get:
"You're the most gormless gawps I've yet met."
"Please don't mock us, dear Dad,
For it makes us all sad
And we'll shop you to Mama, you bet."

I'm pure evil; I'm bad to the bone.
Unrepentant, I never atone
For my sins.  Gotta say,
Many gals love the way
That I roll.  Thus, I'm never alone.

I wanted to purchase a tuba
From a seller residing in Cuba.
I play a nice largo,
But the U.S. embargo
Has forced me to buy from Aruba.

For a badly scraped knee, you might gauze it,
While with cancer, a bandage won't pause it.
But chemo's fantastic,
Antineoplastic!
(I hope you have wigs in the closet.)

If you're hell-bent on knowing the answer
To questions of fate, here's your chance, sir.
For a suitable fee
I will take you to see
A remarkably wise chiromancer.

When you're clodpated (dumb as an ox)
You've the brains of a box full of rocks.
You are missing a card
And, though trying real hard,
Can't make sense of the book Fox in Socks.

Some grass-eating creatures we keep:
A cow, seven goats, and a sheep.
They are known as herbivorous
Or graminivorous.
Their upkeep is pleasantly cheap.

Near Toronto, a birder named Bruce
And a woman who's known to be loose
Watch some waterfowl pass,
When she pinches his ass.
She's a fan of the Canada goose.

When a couple's betrothed, they're engaged,
And a small celebration is staged,
Where their guests bring good wishes,
Nice drinks and warm dishes;
Their exes alone are enraged.

Despite noises all over, things breaking,
I missed a big mess in the making.
A burglar enswept
My whole house while I slept,
But he didn't find stuff that's worth taking.

All those rhymes critics like to impugn
As bromidic, banal, and jejune
Speak the language of love,
Like the doves up above
Who are crooning a honeymoon tune.

How does air behave, up in the skies?
Will my spoiler design win a prize?
Could I model this plane?
All this runs through her brain
When an aerodynamicist flies.

I said, "Waiter, I'm thinking of suing.
There's a fly in my soup that's canoeing."
He replied, with a shrug,
"That Corixa's a bug—
And the breaststroke is what he's been doing."

"All is natural. Nothing is super-,"
Says a deist. "God's off in a stupor.
His indifference dismaying?
Then don't bother praying
To an unconcerned deaf party pooper."

With some seeds, as they first start to grow,
Cotyledons push up from below.
And then once above ground
They don't long hang around,
Those epigeous seed-leaves soon go.

A groupie is often a pest,
Not allowing a rock star to rest.
Not permitting much joy,
One will always annoy,
Yet the problem is rarely addressed.

Jacko did it, kids saw it. It soon
To the break-dancing kids was a boon.
It's a series of moves,
That's like walking, but proves
To work backwardly, like on the moon.

Clarice, just be strong; don't you fright.
You must learn what we need—start tonight.
Even though Dr. Lecter
Will goad, tease and hector,
His bark is much  worse than his bite.

The color within cannot hide;
When gypsum is chemically dried
It's anhydrite, with hue
Of a pale lilac blue,
Renamed angelite, New Agers' pride.

Though a thousand-year flood reached our attic,
Global warming, to Dad, "is just static —
Fake science from Greens!"
Even after such scenes,
Father's fervently anticlimatic.

The carpenter old Mister Barber
Is still fixing wood to my arbour.
To my endless regret,
He has not finished yet.
He is certainly no homo faber.

"There's good land here," the agent had stressed.
"For production of crops, it's the best!
Wheat and corn, understand,
Both grow well on this land."
"I'm too lazy to farm," I confessed.

"Antioxidants," Tetley enthused,
"Are the good stuff in food." I'm confused:
For without oxidation,
Life's short in duration.
"Antiradical's better," I mused.

I greeted the housemaid with gloom:
"It's not clean! There is dust in this room!"
"Just the corners, I think,
So stop making a stink!
Where the walls meet you can't work the broom."

Since I don't see a way to compel him
To leave, I'll just say that I'll sell him.
I'll say slavery's back,
And it's time to go pack.
He'll eat up any lie that I tell him!

Extraord- (that's 'outside' more than 'more')
Plus inarily (adverb, for sure)
Has a length that's unseemly;
I'll stick to extremely
When something fantastic's in store.

Don't like counting by twelves? Don't despair.
Clocks and calendars? Granted, they're there.
And in Tolkien's works, Elvish
Is partially twelve-ish,
But dozenal system's are rare.

"Aromatherapeutics," said Pat,
"Will perk up our health just like that!"
But her husband resents
Spending dollars on scents:
"Darling, frankly, I just smell a rat."

"She's astonishingly sexy, your daughter."
"And strikingly deadly—I taught her.
Better back off and quit. You
Won't know what's just hit you.
You'd go easy, a lamb to the slaughter."

Want a slice from Grimaldi's wit cheese?
Then youse guys betta speak  Brooklynese.
It's da way we all tawk
('Cuz it's friggin' Noo Yawk!)
And no accents are betta den dese!

Doctor Weepy, the famed sentimentalist,
Was, in speech and in outlook, the gentlest.
"If I may, it's like this:
Life is all hit or miss."
Fans cried out, "You're a damn accidentalist!"

The cocoa bean: once Mayan money —
They crushed it and drank it with honey.
To the Mexican Olmecs,
And Aztecs, and Toltecs,
We give thanks for our chocolate bunny.

If I get a sharp twinge in the knee,
Or see shapes in the leaves of my tea,
Or spy a strange star,
I am sure such things are
An abodement of something to be.

Damned lawmakers failed to come through.
Checkoff's gone; we'll lose membership too.
When those guys we endorsed
Told us dues can't be forced—
That's a message we won't misconstrue.

Though his labors that aid are unpaid,
Jay will succor a suffering maid.
Sighed one lady, "I'm cursed
With unquenchable thirst."
From some lemons, Jay made her an ade.

Joe's uneasiness grew to alarm,
As his wife sprayed colognes on her arm.
For the mixture of scents
Formed a pong so intense
That it smelled like the sluice from his farm.

Are there any who're worse than these jerks
Called Al Qaeda? They say they do works
Of avengers and martyrs—
They're really just starters
Of terror who die with their quirks.

A pelican's purpose is mainly
To demonstrate, clearly and plainly,
That natural selection
Affords no protection
'Gainst getting a bird so ungainly.

At a party, an angel appeared.
I rehearsed my approach as I neared.
"This is quite a good dip,"
Was my opening quip.
"Well, it takes one to know one," she sneered.

Said a medical student in Huron,
"In our text, I don't know what page you're on,
But I can't find in mine
How on earth to define
The cell body, a part of the neuron."

It's important to be understood.
My accountant once told me I should
Pay my taxes per anum;
I decided to cane 'im.
(His Latin is not very good.)

"Lads, 'tis risky to sail this old ship!
She's a camberkeeled jinx!" warned our skip.
"If the ship hogged and broke,
We'd be in for a soak.
Down to Davy Jones' locker we'd slip."

Sandra's doctoral studies are ending.
Disquisitionary writing is pending.
Her years to enquire
Are soon to expire.
Re-revisions are all she is tending.

In Times Square it was put up on show,
Sam Shaw's photo of actress Monroe.
It's a classic, first rate:
There she stands, on a grate,
Showing leg with her dress all ablow.

Whatever I do or I say,
I'm diabolized every which way.
Those who demonize me
Must be devils. You see,
That ol' turnabout's only fair play.

I ordered a milk. (Yeah, I'm nerdy.)
What the bartender brought me is curdy;
It's lumpy and thick.
What's the date on it? Sick!
This expired in May—1930!

When you crawl in that bedroll, beware
Of the vaunted nocturnal corsair.
This reduviid bug
Is a bloodsucking thug,
With a bite that brings pain and despair.

As the fittest, it's strongly implied
That all others are weaker worldwide.
We're the kings of the jungle,
And rarely we'll bungle
Attacking our dinner. Such pride!

As a dart thrower, Mark was my mentor.
He advised that before I could enter
A tournament, I
Should give this trick a try:
In a blindfold, he still hit dead center.

Though it's not comme il faut, I am sure,
For our rendezvous you're my amour.
But, pardon my Franglais,
It's bound to go wronglais,
When your husband kicks moi out the door.

If you desecrate something, you soil it,
Degrade it, debase it, despoil it.
You regret being mean,
And you now want it clean?
No, I doubt it will help if you boil it.

With a cognitive therapy session,
I wanted to ease my depression.
I'll never go back,
Though; the doctor's a quack,
And the worst of his chosen profession.

Draconian are always the laws
That will punish the most minor flaws
Of leaders and strippers
Whose hands undo zippers
And won't be denied by a clause.

"In that vid, what you said made me ache;
It is causing my poor heart to break!"
"Don't be fooled — what you see,
Dear, is not really me:
It's a deep learning fake — a deepfake!"

Expressionless, tightly controlled,
His poker-faced countenance told
Not one whit how he felt.
None could tell, as we dealt,
If he'd raise, or stand pat, or just fold.

He's a fellow who sings in the choir,
A bit like a bass, only higher.
The tenor, Lord love him,
Is right there above him,
But the baritone's softer and shyer.

Limburgers, Roqueforts and Bries!
Bring me cheddars and Goudas — oh, please!
But I'd rather eat blubber
Than the gummy bland rubber
That's known as American cheese.

Once I thought I was tough and hard nosed,
But this gig's left me overexposed—
A clay pigeon each day.
Make it all go away!
Umping kids? (Resignation's enclosed.)

With a dado rail fixed in the hall,
We can now paint a two-coloured wall.
Since I'm tall, I shall do
All the top parts (in blue),
Leaving dados for you (since you're small).

Said a guy as he rode on a dinky,
"Choo-choo soot makes my Twinkie turn inky,
And the smoke is so thick
That I feel kind of sick.
Locomotives are often quite stinky!"

This beluga's not found in a tin.
The Arctic's the ocean it's in —
Delphinapterus leucas.
Folks called me a kook, 'cause
I thought this white whale was my kin.

"As guns go," Tom confessed, "Yes, it's tiny."
(With his manhood besmirched, he got whiny.)
"Just lay off what I shoot.
I don't care. It looks cute.
You don't like it? Then go kiss my heinie!"

"This estate's," said my lawyer, "for life."
Dinah's smiles of contentment were rife.
"But," he said, "when you die,
The estate goes bye-bye,
And it cannot be left to your wife."

Bridesmaid Adelaide, all of us know,
Has this itch to get hitched—even so,
Her accosting young Lew
While he muttered "I do"
Was a sure way to darken the show.

"Dr. Blume, I must make a confession,"
Said the man with the doleful expression.
"I found giving a gift
Gave my spirits a lift—
Doromania's now my obsession."

Some imports are subject to duty.
They're dutied—they're taxed—like your booty
Of furs and French fashion
You'd never cook hash in,
Which are worn by the rich and the snooty.

There's a poisonous metal, Cd;
If a battery's dumped, it's set free.
It is known to cause cancer,
A horrible answer
To careless polluters like me.

All-day doesn't always connote
12 or 24 hours.  I could quote:
"All-day trip," "all-day tour,"
"All-day sucker." For sure,
"All-day singing," with lunch, gets my vote.

My faucet leaks — where is the plumber?
My A/C's not working this summer.
First-world problems, I know,
But to me, even so,
Every one of them seems like a bummer.

The Guinness Book records reveal
He ate meals of base metals like steel,
But lost life and desire
When he tried copper wire,
Having left (it was live) half the reel.

At a good hank, I had him, I did:
In the palm of my hand, held that kid.
He was under my thumb.
To the beat of my drum,
Made him march, and he did all I bid.

Shifty Sue, auctioneer, longed for Walter
(A real hunk, and so no one could fault her).
She misled him at length,
Smooth persuasion her strength,
Till she fast-talked her way to the altar.

So the dish and the spoon took flight—Why?
'Little dog', 'cat' and 'fiddle' I'll buy.
But a moon-jumping cow?
Get along with you! How
Could it do it? The moon's far too high!

"By accepting this contract," he said,
"You're agreeing to work 'til you're dead,
Every day, nights and weekends
And then, when your peak ends,
Expect to be dumped on your head."

A floorer's some guy who lays floors,
Those low, flat things you stand on indoors.
And here lay means "put down";
Ain't no messin' around,
And no sex, though he works on all fours.

A bosquet is also a thicket.
There I park without getting a ticket.
Well, of course it's not paved,
But just think what I've saved!
If the town tries to stop me, I'll picket!

As a kid, when I felt in a bind,
There's some fanciful aid I would find
From the tec Bulldog Drummond.
In my mind he was summoned
To give help of a fictional kind.

You're a cage rattler making me mad
For the hell of it.  May I just add
That the cages you rattle
Could spark a small battle.
Your car just got stolen?  Too bad.

Dr. Kisch, a fine diagnostician,
So clever he's thought a magician,
Says, "I use the technology
Of clinical psychology;
I'm just an efficient clinician!"

The new lad is a time-wasting lout,
And, as boss, you feel tempted to shout.
You've employed a bad worker,
A no-darned-good shirker,
Who spends his time faffing about.

I'm a guy: cool with penchants ingrained,
Gender-bending (when aptly retained),
Then wear clothes feministic,
But I go ballistic
When mocked—rant and rave, unrestrained!

Watch her battle that green acid sprayer
Or the Big Bad who's Sunnydale's mayor.
These creatures all breed in
The mind of Joss Whedon
For Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Contraceptive pill?  — some folk will tease:
Grip an aspirin tight with your knees!
Girls with ticklish feet
Let it roll in the sheet —
They might just as well drink antifreeze!

As a goalie, my heartbroken daughter
Has found herself deep in hot water.
When the game was all done,
Her team lost five to one,
And in soccer four goals is a slaughter.

When two naval cadets, full of brew,
Went for haircuts, the sniggering grew;
They had asked for a trim—
"Though," said one, "not like him,
'Cause he's just said he fancies the crew."

I've heard Allium Piper (from goats)
For "Best Down Under Cheese" would win votes.
With a peppery pizzazz,
This delicious cheese has
"No intense goaty taste," my source notes.

That great sci-fi creator was clear.
The one phrase science most loves to hear,
'Cause it's right on the money,
Is the statement "That's funny,"
Since it heralds discovery: it's near.

Let's censure The Sensualist Wencher List,
This life's-an-erotic-adventure list.
"Women, in essence,
Are all adolescents."
That's sexist and, yes, it's essentialist.

Compulsory figures? Don't think
That our waistlines must bulge or must shrink!
They are figures on ice
And they must be precise
To compete in an ice-skating rink.

Baron Basil has started a hassle.
All us freemen he plans to envassal.
That would make me a serf,
Forced to work on his turf.
(Serf and turf both belong to his castle.)

"Your opinion? Completely distressing!
Find my plot too complex? So I'm guessing;
Surplus ladies and gents
In too many events?
Would you say War and Peace needs compressing?"

I just can't take my eyes off  that blonde.
I approach and we talk and we bond —
Says she'll give me her head
To examine in bed.
Craniognomy calls: I respond.

I collect action figures—so what?
I've got Anakin, Jabba the Hut,
Han Solo, Darth Vader
And Leia (won't trade her—
The one that's dressed up like a slut!).

As I travel this desolate road
With a crushing, unbearable load
That is killing me now,
I don't know when and how
I will find a well-fitted commode.

Ace high is a hand that can win
When it's poker and no one who's in
Has so much as a pair.
With a queen, do I dare
See his tenner and raise it a fin?

When I see that our rules have been breached
And my sermon on evil's been preached—
Don't stand in my way,
I've got demons to slay—
For my boiling point's finally been reached.

Three sheets to the wind at the bar?
Not a problem—they'll send you a car.
Got a flat and no spare?
Boom! A tow truck's right there.
Hail, dispatchers! (Wherever they are.)

In my own university town,
"Dressing up" means white tie and a gown,
Plus a hood or a bonnet.
(The stains they get on it
Should get academics dressed down.)

In the time before Noah's great flood,
Our shared ancestor crawled from the mud
And established a line.
We're consanguine. Divine!
Through that stud, we're related by blood.

Rhetorical rants against Bush
Come from some with agendas to push.
"I don't follow, professor.
Why's Bush the aggressor?
'Cause he's kicking some terrorist tush?"

Elementary school was the place
Where the tests were so easy to ace.
Later, high school was stressing;
On tests I was guessing.
My grades were a total disgrace.

In olde London one didn't transgress,
For a bilbo would make you confess.
The crown warden, dyslexic —
"b" or "d"? So perplexic!
But such pleasure was had by Queen Bess.

This Canuck had a mission, a flame
For democracy, fairness his aim.
Soon his medicare scheme
Became more than a dream:
Tommy Douglas earned well his acclaim.

There's a church trying hard to subdue
Any non-church-approved point of view.
They all show an affinity
For mindless bovinity.
Instead of "Amen," they should moo!

In phonetics, dentality's what
Sounds possess that explode from the spot
Where our tongues, at their tips,
Touch our teeth, while our lips
Stay apart—as in "thither" and "thought."

In the backcourt, you're farther away
From the tennis court's net when you play,
So the ball's hit, of course,
Using maximum force;
Tennis victories happen that way.

Road repairmen, named Willie and Walt,
Had their paving work come to a halt.
A huge chunk of the street
Slowly sank 'neath their feet.
"Don't blame me, Walt, that's your big ass fault."

Though I speak with impeccable grammar,
I'm dysphemic—that means that I stammer.
Each sentence I mutter
Is plagued with a stutter,
And utterly robbed of its glamor.

The big pasture holds nobody surlier.
And nuts? I'm sure no one is squirrelier.
Though he's there, it appears,
For the next thirty years,
Good behavior could get him out earlier.

A fine-featured fellow from France
Fell for Fifi (a floozie). Her glance
Made his fancy take flight,
But each fortnight they'd fight.
Could fair Fifi be faithful? Fat chance!

Your home's mortgage? No payments were made.
The insurance and taxes weren't paid.
So those failures mean those
That you owe must foreclose.
You're now homeless, dishoused, I'm afraid.

You've a bontebok?  Goodness, take care!
This South African antelope's rare!
With its dark reddish coat
And white rump, you should note,
When you walk it your neighbors will stare.

A charitable cause wants my cash,
But hurried donations are rash.
I have to decide
If the group's bona fide,
And then to my checkbook I'll dash.

There's a tool called a darby which shows
Up on jobs where the tradesmen compose
The refined plaster coat.
As one said, "Now I float —
Smoothing out the too-highs and the lows."

When doc prescribes something emulsive,
And you drink it and find it revulsive,
Keep a stiff upper lip
Though you gag as you sip;
Downing milk of magnesia's repulsive.

Poor Bill was an unlucky feller—
Bricked his old lady up in the cellar.
Well, it all seemed okay
When he hid her in May,
But come August, the whole town could smell 'er.

I went out to a vet in Manhasset,
And came home with what looks like a basset.
We go walking for sport:
Though its legs are real short
It still takes me an hour to pass it.

The third deepest in all the world round
Of all natural harbours is found
In fair Falmouth, a town
Of old Cornish renown:
For both sailing and filming it's sound.

Secret meetings — outsiders can't know
What they say there.  I wish I could go
Like a fly on the wall,
Sight unseen, hear it all —
Get the goods on those bastards, ho ho!

Words and sentences must be grammatical.
I correct how friends speak — I'm fanatical.
So take care what you say,
Even though I'm away —
I'll keep checking despite my sabbatical.

At the tannery, Louie presides
Over all of the crew. He decides
Who works where. He might say,
"You're a beamster today."
That's the guy who dehairs all the hides.

"Disagreement we cannot afford!"
Dan cries, "Consonance!" (That means 'accord.')
"Only consonants?" Howells
Growls, "What about vowels?"
(Sheer foolishness—that's Dan's reward.)

"This antelope chop's overdone,
So I'll head for the blind with my gun"—
Though a blaubok I sought,
There were none to be caught;
You'd have thought I just ate the last one.

He's covered in prison tattoos,
And that looks like fresh blood on his shoes.
I've got my suspicions
The Sunday edition's
Too thin for this stack of bad news.

"Be my baby, be mine!" belts out Dinah.
(She's loud.  They could hear her in China.)
Backed by bongos and harps,
Same sad song in two sharps.
We all call her our "singin' be-miner".

Great Babylon's king loosed the truss
On Jehoiachin; made quite a fuss.
But Evil-Merodach,
Named so like a toad—ack!—
Can't quite be seen kindly by us.

There are laws that we all must obey.
Disobedience means that you may
Find police at your door
To confront you and more:
They could haul your dumb carcass away.

Amianthum—this plant may surprise.
It is useful for poisoning flies.
If it's mashed up and spread,
It will render flies dead;
But take care. Keep it out of your eyes.

If you're needing an all over tan
Like Adonis (a God and a man)
Then it might be your fate
That you have to rotate,
Which is hard for a virile young man.

For his toothache, Philandering Merv
Applied clove oil to deaden the nerve.
Those botanical drops
Made him numb in the chops,
But they helped get his mind back to 'luurv'.

Shall we try a short feather cut, hon?
It's a do that's both easy and fun.
And (let's cut to the chase)
It will frame that sweet face.
You won't know yourself after we're done.

Be Prepared is a creed that sounds geeky.
It is cooler today to be sneaky.
To a Boy Scout, his word
Must be honored. "Absurd!"
Sneer his classmates. "Your morals are freaky!"

All termites, report to your station!
Start chewing this house's foundation!
Its rafters erode—
It's abode a la mode
Through our biodeterioration!

Said a ravenous chick in St. Pete,
Who wanted Chinese food to eat,
"I think a nice dish
Might be veggies or fish.
I'm too chicken to eat chicken feet."

Said Monsieur, without further ado,
"Shall we kindle affection anew?
Let us drain some champagne
On the plain by the Maine—
Just us two, me and you, in Anjou."

If you want to be nasty you might
Rip a fart. I suspect it's not trite
To imply that your toot
Should be silent to boot.
A loud fart is all bark and no bite.

Odz bodkins! I'm bodkinned! It's true.
I'm the third in a space built for two.
What a pleasant surprise
To be squeezed 'twixt the thighs
Of two lovely young ladies like you.

He can learn; he's got great versatility,
Backed by dignity, looks and virility.
Would they vote for him? No,
'Cause he can't run The Show.
Popularity's not electability.

When in Britain I'm visiting kin,
What's on telly each night makes me grin.
There's a dog show or cat show,
A horse show or chat show;
I hardly know where to begin.

When it comes to affairs, Dale's a frail man,
Not a constantly looking-for-tail man.
He stays true to Marie,
Though, concomitantly, she
Has been screwing two cops and the mailman.

Amelia nixes perfumers
And ladylike dress—hence the rumors.
She shows up in pants
At the temperance dance.
Later on she'll be doffing her bloomers.

To our bar, one fine morn late last year,
Came a ham and some eggs wanting beer.
But our bouncer got sore,
Quickly showed them the door
As he said, "We don't serve breakfast here."

Said God, "On your belly you'll crawl,"
To those treacherous snakes; of them all,
It might well have been
In His mind, at the scene,
That an elapid triggered the Fall.

Some surgery known as cosmetic
Is rightly considered pathetic,
Like women with Cs
Who elect double-Ds
In a quest for a higher…aesthetic.

Our new moat filled with sharks is defensive
And has Mum feeling less apprehensive.
We have not been attacked
Since the hammerheads snacked—
The bit villain had wounds, quite extensive.

"Human cannonball, Bob? I'm astounded,
As well," said my friend, "as confounded.
Do you have, for that job,
The right calibre, Bob?"
"Oh, I think so," I said. "I'm well-rounded."

Mr. Thomas Stearns Eliot, that's
Not a poet who wrote much for brats;
But some musical blossoms
Arose from Old Possum's
(A kids) Book of Practical Cats.

I'll embosom my child; I'll enclose
And I'll shelter him—save him from foes.
While I foster and cherish
The boy, he won't perish.
I'll nurture my son while he grows.

The anophelines, not at all new,
Carry pathogens tough to subdue.
In Brazil, it's malaria;
On the Nile, add filaria.
These mosquitoes spread viruses, too.

So athletic's the long-legged emu
He's very unlikely to deem you
Half worthy of racing
Those limbs he loves gracing.
He knows that on one he could cream you.

The birthstone of violet quartz
Known as amethyst, legend purports,
Protects one from drinking,
So imbibe without thinking
From cups made from gems of these sorts.

Tom's solitaire game got no boost
After four of the cards had vamoosed.
"Wait a sec!  What the heck!
This is not a full deck.
Every two's been unloosed," Tom deduced.

There's so much that I must demythologize
About dating. No need to psychologize,
As it's natural—seems
That you needn't hatch schemes.
Be yourself. There's no need to apologize.

Conversation with you is a chore.
You're a nitpicking windbaggy bore!
You're so smug and pedantic
You're driving me frantic.
I'm rattled, freaked, frenzied, and more.

If our words are too modern for you,
Or you hunger to see us renew
Some outdated sets
Of language, then let's
Have archaic and eateth it too.

A bright I.T. auditor, Jill,
Found auditing ledgers no thrill.
So she left, bought a farm;
Now she's happy and calm
With her husband, named Jack, by a hill.

My convexness was never in doubt:
All who see me agree that I'm stout.
When I eat, not a scrap
Ever falls in my lap…
If you find it, just give me a shout.

When it rains on the day your parade
Has been planned, a decision is made.
Don't bother the chancellor,
As I'll be the canceller;
For giving bad news I am paid.

My hospital stay is endurable
Since they say my mild ailment is curable;
And there's one pretty sister—
I haven't yet kissed her,
But there's something that tells me she's lurable.

This year's bring-and-buy charity sale
Has a booth vending donated ale.
Pockets empty more readily
When we're thinking less steadily.
Well done, gents — let pickings prevail!

Cleopatra was not a Cairene—
Alexandria's where she was seen.
It was capital then,
Under Ptolemies, when
Julius Caesar fell hard for this queen.

A war-weary vet from Dalmatia
Had served long in defense of Croatia.
"I can't rise, can't get hard,"
He sobbed. "Žena, I'm scarred!
Now I drag, draga, due to acratia."

A dominie's job is to preach.
A dominie's job is to teach.
A United States pastor—
A Scottish schoolmaster—
They are dominies both, one of each.

I complain about methods dentistic;
I consider them crude and sadistic.
It is not 'cause I've got
A whole mouthful of rot.
My opinion is quite realistic.

I can't for the life of me see
Abiologists spending on me
Analytical time,
And the reason is I'm
Not inanimate. Hi-yo! Whoopee!

An equilibratory sort of a man,
He balances things when he can:
Offers no crazy schemes,
Never goes to extremes —
Equilibrium seems his life's plan.

There's smooth ice, and it's time for a skate.
Grab my gloves and my toque; I don't wait.
A long slide as I glide;
With the snowbank collide ...
Stand back up for a great figure 8.

I have found there's an obsolete word
That when used as a noun means "a herd".
As a verb, it is true,
It means "graze". I'll tell you,
This word's creaght (rhymes with eight, I've inferred).

MARGARET THATCHER, a master disarmer,
Was friendly and calm—no alarmer.
Charisma, allure?
She had plenty, for sure,
As this anagram shows: THAT GREAT CHARMER.

Though we're born from a uterine sac,
To its warmth we can never go back.
To look in, amnioscopy—
Also known as fetoscopy.
(Use a light, as inside it's pitch-black.)

Coliseums had lower-tier sections
For fans with important connections.
From the aisle 'round the middle
(The balteus), piddle
Showed trickle-down class disaffections.

"Wear anything," Joe said, "but clothes
At our ABC party, like bows,
Balloons, feathers, whatever.
Be creative and clever.
Just make sure nothing intimate shows."

Disaffected and greasy-haired teens
Wearing black leather jackets and jeans
Disregard and reject
All the things you'd expect.
They're called greasers. That's what the word means.

In Sri Lanka, the danio fish
Live in streams where they swim with a swish.
Here they live in aquaria—
They're big in this area.
I'll sell you a few, if you wish.

If a miner puts posts with his name
On a vein that he hopes will bring fame,
And then drives a pole down
Through the ground for renown,
Would we say that he's staking acclaim?

Andy's been to Peru, where it snowed;
Drove to Chile by mountainous road.
He photoed the Andes
(The peaks, not the candies),
An' dese are the places he goed.

I snooze underground (not too deep),
Till the dawn, when I wake up and peep
With my bright bunny eyes
From my burrow, whose size
Makes it cosy: a warm place to sleep.

What an ill-tempered rotter is Jim,
Disagreeable, crusty and grim,
Chippy, surly and ratty.
He drives us all batty.
You're mad to be marrying him.

This mineral, treated, yields lime.
What's the term we should use? Seems that I'm
For the word calcariferous,
While you say calciferous.
Thank goodness the two versions rhyme!

Air Force One has a code name not known
By most folks except those who have flown
With the president's staff.
Try to stifle your laugh—
Secret Service says "Angel" by phone.

Peter's seeming indifference, his easiness,
Is admired, but to me it brings queasiness.
When conditions were rough,
He was careful enough,
But success has engendered a breeziness.

At a hot-water vent in mid-ocean,
A descent will encourage the notion
That the chimneys that grow
Over creatures below
Spew a life-giving magical potion.

"You insist there should not be one where?
In 'Potato's'? Look guv, I don't care!"
And just what was the fault;
Of this ignorant dolt?
An apostrophe shouldn't be there!

Ol' Billy's a mighty fine curer.
His recipes couldn't be surer.
His alder-smoked fish?
It tastes simply delish,
And his bacon and ham cause a furor.

I slept poorly; my sleep-time was spotty
(Intermittent). My bedclothes got knotty,
And I'm lacking in witfulness
From that nighttime of fitfulness.
(Twenty times—yes—I went to the potty.)

You ask what on Earth is a deelie?
In Seattle, they use that term freely
To mean "doohickey"/"dingus"/
"Whatever-that-thing-is":
So pretty much anything, really.

When a rich bastard wants to insult yer,
He'll accuse you of having no culture.
"What a cultureless swine!"
This Lord Snooty will whine.
Better cultureless, mate, than a vulture.

I'm a granny, but youthful, you know?
Childish pastimes I'll never forgo.
I'm, like, totally smart
And just so young at heart!
(Slightly older in other parts, though.)

Asparagus makes your wee smell—
Or so many people will tell.
It once was a  lily,
And it grows willy-nilly.
Young shoots are delicious as well.

She's been up to her devious teaser tricks.
They're meaner than Scrooge (Ebenezer) tricks.
We'll be ousted and wrecked,
As that bitch will eject
And evict us—the evil disseisitrix!

You're obstructive, forestalling my spending,
But that won't see our savings ascending.
Our account PIN you've changed,
But since then I've arranged
A new credit card. Shopping's unending!

A favela's a slum in Brazil
Where a fella might come for a thrill,
Seeking danger and love,
But find microbes—and of
Salmonella succumb.  Germs can kill.

Counted cross-stitch? Its heart is a chart
Full of symbols, the craft's signal part.
A vast palette of flosses
And stitches like crosses
Make a mighty fine stand-in for art.

What is sought by the English top brass?
