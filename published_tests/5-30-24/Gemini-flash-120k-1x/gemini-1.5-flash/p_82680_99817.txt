This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible. 



In college we learn about Psych
And Bio and Chem and the like.
By that last, I allude
To some more of this brood.
(Not Econ, though — that school's on strike.)

"Hello" is a term I'd supply
If someone I knew should stop by.
But Australians would say
A curt phrase like "g'day,"
And yet have it emerge as "g'die."

Though an editor might be insistent,
If a limerick writer's persistent,
He eschews inconsistency,
Preferring consistency,
Making sure that his rhymes are consistent.

Dermatobia's larvae begin
As ova placed under the skin
Of a goat or a cow—
Or a human?—and how!
See this nasty red bump on my shin?

On conducting his tests he's intent.
His experimentalist bent
Means his normal M.O.
Is a thorough and slow
Set of trials, which he then can present.

For my eight-year-old princess's sake,
We've one heck of a party to make.
We've balloons and a clown;
We have painted the town;
We—my God! We've forgotten the cake!

I have asked every girl in the town out,
And their put-downs I wish I could drown out.
I don't look like Don Juan
With the lights fully on,
But I might do all right in a brownout.

You'll be full of remorse when I've died.
As for method I can't quite decide.
I'll be taking my life
With a gun, noose or knife,
'Cos my oven's electric — I tried.

Nasty gesture: to gnash teeth in rage,
('Twas the style in an earlier age)
But bruxistic night grinding,
Per our dentist's reminding,
Is a vice in which hordes now engage.

Though the old Blue Ridge Mountains aren't high,
Autumn's colors blaze bright to the eye.
Verdant vistas through haze
Never cease to amaze;
Mountain sunsets can make lovers sigh.

It just makes me livid, said Ross.
The team's passing is not worth a toss.
When Celtic are playing
At Rangers, start praying
To God for a half-decent cross.

There are subsidies, tax breaks, and more
In that Christmas tree bill on the floor
Of the Senate.  Campaign
Contributions explain
Why they're hanging amendments galore.

When a late concert-goer arrived
To discover that he was deprived
Of his seat till next curtain,
He started in flirtin'
With the doorman — a palship short-lived.

While it's true you are often pursued
By young men since you're frequently viewed
Wearing minimal clothes,
There are limits, God knows!
You just can't go around in the nude.

I've been living a dog's life, it's true.
I have nothing at all I must do;
I've no errands to run,
Just have sex, booze, and fun —
And my pampered dog Blue lives one too.

Blooming algae in ponds forms a scum weed
With slimy, green clumps (such a bum weed),
While out on the plains
In the scantiest rains
Blooms the golden-crowned curlycup gumweed.

The Vatican doesn't like sass;
It's wise not to irk its top brass.
"Mary Moss is a brat!
Excommunicate, stat!"
Means Miss Moss is a mess who'll miss Mass.

Cherophobia sufferers say,
"We get anxious when happy or gay."
Fear of gaiety? True!
It could happen to you.
Play it safe and get glummer today.

Only those with a broad Scottish brogue
Can confirm that the cog's not in vogue.
For some long-ago folk,
Such a vessel of oak
Was a pail or a cup (same as cogue).

To refer to the time in between
Two specific events, I have seen
People using pro tem,
But consider this gem:
Ad interim says what you mean.

Carpal tunnel: a place in my wrist
Where my finger and thumb muscles twist,
But I do so much typing,
I'm recently griping:
My tunnel's developed a cyst.

If you're tossing a coin in the air,
Irrespective of whether it's fair,
For each ratio thrown,
Probability's known,
And predictably common or rare.

I'll explain the word explanate now.
"Spread out flat" is its gist, I'll avow:
Like a sat-upon hat,
Or a run-over cat,
Or the shape of a house-dropped-on cow.

To the cistern the brethren go out
In the midst of a terrible drought.
Though they hope and they pray
There'll be water today,
There is nun coming out of the spout.

I'm the type that resents taking rest,
Which was harmful, as I convalesced.
So they tied me down tight
When they turned off the light
At eight-thirty — "It's all for the best!"

Do you feel neither sadness nor joy?
Don't you love your own son? My dear boy,
You're disnatured, I fear.
The position is clear;
You're the perfectly un-real McCoy.

Words won't flow if you've got writer's block.
Blocked-up veins give your ticker a knock.
There's a Blockbuster store
Up the block—fun galore—
Unblocks stress knots as hard as a rock.

There's the Nethy,  the Clyde,  and the Dee—
Ancient towns on these rivers there be,
But not Naberneethy,
Nor yet Abernethy,
Near Nethy, the Tay, and the sea.

His IQ?  He's no Einstein, no Plato.
In the fam'ly of Trump, he's their Fredo.
Don, the dud of the brood
Who's construed to collude,
Dumped on Daddy a red-hot potato.

Diamond wedding (their second) means five-
and-seventy years! They arrive
With the same spouse they wed.
And, yes, this should be said —
Both the parties must still be alive.

With a breeze under leaf, over frond,
Would you linger by Looking-Glass Pond?
Or wander the maze,
And the unicorn ways,
Of the Forest of Brocéliande?

In the western U.S. grows a pine,
Ponderosa or bull.  To make trine,
Add the name western yellow
For this ponderous fellow —
A three-needled-fascicle line.

On a scale when I last checked my weight
Was this reading, in pounds: 308.
I'll forego all things greasy,
Go easy on cheesy
Bean dips, and put less on my plate.

We're the women with colpocystitis:
Inflammation that serves to unite us.
With vaginas this sore
(Bladders, too!), we abhor
Puerile jokes that make light of or slight us.

About 38 weeks from creation
Of life until birth is gestation;
And some people like you
Can live all their lives through
And yet never achieve separation.

To generate limericks, young Jake
Wrote a program that sure takes the cake!
Now computers will write
Without humans? Not quite:
"and the knight youre alive in the clown"

Roberta's reluctant to share
Her collection of clips, so beware
If you're thinking of making
A hobby of taking
Her bobby pins out of her hair.

As his Barbie snores softly, asleep,
Ken's still deeply engaged counting sheep.
He thinks, "Quit, go on strike—
All these sheep look alike.
What I'd give for a little Bo Peep."

These crystals are pointed and green;
Monoclinic, with cleavage quite clean.
While an out-of-date hack might
Still use the term acmite,
The true name is this: aegirine.

Barry Bonds crushes balls with his swing.
His power made Giants fans sing.
But if Barry took 'roids,
He potentially voids
Any claim to be called "Home Run King".

Assanka's a very rare word
Only used by the brainiest nerd.
It's 10 to a power
So big it can tower
To 63 zeros — absurd!

They used to build ships for the king.
In exchange he allowed them to bring
Foreign goods of all sorts
To the land of Cinque Ports;
As for taxes—they meant not a thing.

Though it only has twenty-eight days,
It's the month in which fortitude frays.
All our fingers and toes 'n'
Our noses are frozen.
For spring, every one of us prays.

What? You're miffed by my very first line?
So upset that you whimper and whine?
I'm aware—have no fears—
Once in every four years
Little February's got twenty-nine.

So your kidneys have failed from infection?
Choose a spare from my modest collection.
Our tissue types match,
So it's fit as a patch
Once they've drugged you for antirejection.

For a lady who's, well, 'middle-aged',
Urgent need must be quickly assuaged;
But her needs won't be sated:
They'll rage unabated
When she finds all the loos are engaged.

"I want breasts on my woman!" he said.
So with implants her bust-line she spread.
But her new guy reproved
So she had them removed.
At her implant-free breasts, baby's fed.

Manufacturing processes vary;
Conforming to specs can be hairy.
But there are no enigmas:
Plot mean and three sigmas,
And for points outside limits, be wary.

Not a braggart, I'm never a boaster;
Still my face graces Ride-a-Way's poster,
'Cause the size of my grin
Is as wide as the spin
From the hills and the loops of their coaster.

You respond with a wearisome rant,
And your eyebrows all furrowed, aslant.
Though I've tried once or twice
To pretend being nice,
Still you greet me with glances askant.

My mom washed my mouth out with lye,
Then she swore up a storm in reply.
So my ears were the next
To be scrubbed; I was vexed
As an aurilave burnished them dry.

Cabrerite's a name from the past—
I'd suggest you forget it and fast!
For our science today
Wants it taken away,
Then deleted, disbarred, and declassed!

Geological surveys revealed
What the aeons of time had congealed:
The earth's ancient stocks
Of its wide range of rocks
With their long-hidden secrets unsealed.

Anchovies: delicious small fishes
That people include in some dishes.
They have strong salty flavour
That many folks savour.
On pizza, though, not what I wishes.

Assignment: "Write lims on each word,
Though most, we are sure, you've not heard."
For days I stared, blear-eyed,
And drank too much beer. I'd
Been shunning the trite rhyme absurd.

When you badmouth male lawyers and blame
Them for all the world's ills, it's a shame.
It seems wrong to slang men
Just 'cause nine out of ten
Of them give all the rest a bad name.

A chironomid's one of those midges
That are found around lakes and neath bridges—
A mosquito-like sight,
But polite—they don't bite,
So your skin's not in lumpy red ridges.

Irish writers? There's none with a voice
As distinctive as that of James Joyce.
Read his Dubliners tales;
Their allure never fails,
And among them, The Dead's my first choice.

He'd a cramp in his side; it was sore.
The calyces deep in the core
Of the aching left kidney
Of the fellow from Sydney
Caused pain that he couldn't ignore.

The bay lynx is agile and muscular;
He hunts both the large and minuscular.
On a deer he may pounce,
Or a grasshopper's bounce
May attract in the dusk—he's crepuscular.

Walter Denton liked class with Miss Brooks,
But his girlfriend's old man's dirty looks
Kept the school in a tizzy.
Walter strove to keep busy,
And I don't mean just hitting the books.

I hate to engrieve you, my dear!
I am causing you anguish, I fear,
And by giving you pain
In your overwrought brain,
I may drive you to cry in your beer.

A catnapper  kidnaps your kitty
(A thought that is not very pretty).
To prevent this, take care
And don't catnap; beware!
He might seize your Burmese—more's the pity!

"Is it art or a duck?" I'd begun
To regret this live sculpture I'd done
(A brown teal named Marie
Painted purple), since we
Laid an egg here in more ways than one.

The cyclone is spiralling tighter.
She's a monster, a bloody great blighter.
So batten your hatches,
Buy batteries and matches,
And hunker in bunkers. Here's Ita!

It's a sauce that's so good it's a crime.
There is sage, coriander, and thyme.
Olive oil is the base;
Lemon juice has a place.
À la grecque makes your dishes sublime.

As our catapult's ball, with a smack,
Strikes the stones of their wall, will it crack?
On behalf of our liege,
We surround and besiege
'Til their fortresses fall to attack.

Adulterous people perplex,
Going outside of marriage for sex.
By performing this feat,
One is labeled a cheat
And can often wind up as an ex.

"Canvas climber? That's me, 'Salty' Taylor.
The Atlantic's my home, on a whaler.
For great paintings I search
So upon them I'll perch?
Not at all. That just means I'm a sailor.

I've some films that my doc let me borrow
To help me to deal with my sorrow.
I don't know what to think
When I hear from my shrink:
"Take two dramas and call me tomorrow."

For the modern adventure, there's air travel.
With your partner, excursions are pair travel.
Fly off for vacation
To a choice destination;
With scarce mishaps, you'll seldom have scare travel.

So the deans are concerned that the frosh
Are subsisting on butternut squash.
But who cares if the hordes
Love those flavorful gourds;
They're nutritious, you fascists! My gosh!

My bio's a fictionalization
That bears just the barest relation
To the truth about me;
But it helps, you'll agree,
To improve my depraved reputation.

OEDILF's editors say that you owe 'em:
"It's been months since you turned in a poem!"
But you fight writer's block,
So you give them some schlock
That's impossibly bad. That'll show 'em!

Benzopyrene a bloke might obtain
From the smoke of a coal-fired train:
Five fused honeycomb rings—
Polycyclical things—
Twenty carbons arranged in a plane.

The carangids I catch from the piers
Of St. Petersburg always draw jeers.
Since they're pitifully small,
Every time I just bawl
And toss back my "crevalles of tears."

I remember each curve and much more
On the footpath I trod once before,
All the rocks, all the roots,
All the places my boots
Left their marks on my way to your door.

"What happened to all of the flowers,"
Said Jenny, "that fill up my hours?"
"I just cut the lawn;
Now your plants are all gone,"
Tom said, balefully, "piled up in towers."

Let's review what in life's sure, or certain.
If you go to a dance and are flirtin',
The guy who'll respond
May come on like James Bond—
But in looks? Nowhere near Richard Burton.

A cow in Kentucky I know
Loved Duke Ellington's music, and so
She would listen while grazing
On bluegrass.  Amazing,
From then on she mooed indigo.

Disemployment's a present-day threat.
"Your job has been cut, I regret,"
Says your boss. You're dismayed.
Unemployment, unpaid,
Causes tears, maybe blood, but less sweat.

I'm polite and in no way a churl,
And I've never tried kissing a girl,
But I gave one, last week,
A small peck on the cheek.
On the lips next? I'll give it a whirl.

Though this trait, when it's present, is not
Often mentioned now, those who ain't got
Any pity today,
Or a conscience, we say,
Lack compunction — and don't give a jot.

Banished and exiled — disgraced —
With a life far from home he is faced.
No one knows what he did
For he's keeping it hid,
Though they're certain it's something debased.

Before entering, best be aware
There's a big ol' fandango in there.
Tomfoolery reigns
As sobriety wanes.
It's plain goofy — a giddy affair.

The result of a hookup gone bad,
My daughter's best friend never had
Any male in the role
Of a father.  That hole
Has been filled; I'm her surrogate dad.

Something sticky demands delinition,
And our children uphold that tradition:
Many smears mar the grace
Of their grandparents' place,
But there's never a trace of contrition.

In some children we see, as they've grown,
Genu valgum (or knock-knee it's known).
The result? They will never
Have feet close together,
And bent legs will be what they own.

My garden's all spotty with cu-
cumber blight, called mosaic, it's true.
This plant-eating virus
Leaves no one desirous
Of sampling my veggie fondue.

The old skydiving record was beat
On a free-fall from ten thousand feet:
When near one thousand Thais
Honoured Bhumibol's wise-
ness and sixty-year reign in his seat.

I love splurging—but not at full price!
So, a store that gives cashback is nice.
Using money I'll earn
From the sprees, I'll return
To that store and buy more in a trice.

Rural hedgerows in Britain provide
Secure shelter for livestock, while wide
Five-bar gates made of wood
Provide access. They're good,
Even if (latches broken) they're tied.

Whenever new victims I'm meeting,
I'll extend a most affable greeting,
Like, "Hello, nice to meet you!"
Which is how I might greet you
Ere giving your body a beating.

Said Winken to Blinken and Nod,
"This nurs'ry life's awfully odd.
Here we lie, in a shoe,
An extremely young crew—
Unworldly, unwashed, and unshod."

Chased downstairs with great humour, he tripped;
Caught his sleeve on a hook and it ripped.
Then this farcical chase
Left him red in the face
When his trousers were, somehow, unzipped.

Certain stars, in their dusk-to-dawn trip,
Well below the horizon will dip.
Circumpolar stars, though,
From set latitudes glow
Through the night and from sight never slip.

If two persons receive equal share
So, in consequence, nothing's left spare,
Use this phrase: it's quite nifty,
And means fifty-fifty.
Even stevens means all's fair and square.

If a drug runner swallows some dope
To conceal it, you haven't a hope
Of revealing his crime,
Save by passage of time
Or the use of a celioscope.

I lean back, tugging down on my cap.
Then I leisurely start in to dap,
Placing bait in real slow
Without making a show.
Now who needs all that fly-casting crap?

Her antennae, excitable wands,
Are a-quiver above her broad frons —
That's the bit one espies
Right between her big eyes,
Which are black, while her chitin is bronze.

Time to pay. Think our service comes cheap?
Here's your statement — now read it and weep.
Think it's steep? It's not fair?
Well, guess what — I don't care.
Cough it up, man, you're into us deep.

Lord, the lengths to which parents have gone!
For their two-year-old daughter, named Dawn,
Tom and Tess, to impress,
Bought a babyhouse! Yes!
What I wonder is, who mows the lawn?

I bust say, I have dot bid dis ill
Id a while. Cobbid codes are doh thrill.
Frub by bouth, you'll hear sdoring;
By doze? Dodstop pouring.
I'b going idsade, deed a pill!

Along freshwater wetlands dispersed,
A blue flag is an iris emersed,
Also called fleur-de-lis.
Blue flag also can be
A clean beach, Scottish saltire, de-versed.

While survivors are not done with crying,
When they've not yet abandoned denying,
Perhaps meat's in decay—
Larval flesh fly buffet.
Sarcophagidae dine on the dying.

Some dialects use the word dern
(Most say "darn", but that's of no concern).
Just an expletive's meant,
Not to swearing extent
(Some confuse with sock mending, in turn).

Tipper rushed to the video store
With a deathly strong yearning to score
Something horribly thrilling
With torture and killing
And bloodiness (plenty of gore).

When a limerick elicits a scoff
Or is crude in its terms (e.g. boff),
For the sake of the young
And the tempered of tongue,
We with courtesy curtain it off.

It's carefulness, mindfulness, heed,
And discretion this gambler will need
To exhibit to get
Himself clear of his debt,
But, alas, he's bedeviled by greed.

In school, they're unlikely to teach
The rules of colloquial speech.
Though perfectly normal,
It's loose and informal,
And "ain't" ain't considered a breach.

Stephen King writes of horror and pain
In this city where folks must deplane
For "No Fly" listed names,
Or behavior that shames:
This is Bangor, where terror meets Maine.

"What's Callistephus?" asked the headmaster.
Jack replied, "It's a plant—China aster!"
But it took him an hour
To remember that flower.
"That's correct, but you ought to think faster!"

A lady who lives in Tacoma
Has a tumor, but not a lymphoma.
She really feels fine,
As she's learned it's benign—
On her glomus, a chemodectoma.

A winemaking monk, a young Dom,
One night shattered the old abbey's calm.
Pérignon failed to rein
CO2 in champagne,
And the cork blasted off like a bomb!

Acantho-'s from Greek and means "spine."
It's a prefix and helps to define
Plants with thorns/things vertebral
(Used by folks most cerebral),
And tree surgeons think it divine.

She was young, naïve, innocent, sweet,
Till her pimp sent her out on the street;
Now her fancy man scowls
Round his fat, sweaty jowls
'Cause to him she's just cash-making meat.

You love windmills?  Try growing the grass
That will give your lawn plenty of class.
If you nurture a lot o'
This Chloris truncata
Your neighbors will smile as they pass.

I discovered some galls on a tree;
Found the insect name, using a key.
All recorded and dated
And published. Elated!
Happy cecidiologist, me.

How your boots and your shoes make me sweat!
I'm afraid of your footgear, you bet!
There is never a lack
Of your tracks on my back —
You're the best dominatrix I met.

Credit life is insurance you buy
That would settle your loan should you die.
Your superb credit score
Would remain as before.
(Like you'd care, on your cloud in the sky.)

Albariño's a wine grape from Spain;
Makes a crisp and dry drink that you'd drain
From your glass if you sipped some,
And if you had dripped some,
No problem 'cause white wines won't stain.

Since my lunch, seven brews I have downed,
Watched TV (football—nothing profound),
Played some tunes (Britney Spears),
Dug some wax from my ears.
Wasting time, I'm just farting around.

"Fifty pence for the fair — games and stalls —
Tombola and skittles with balls.
I am fund-raising, see!"
"For the poor?" "No, for me —
Pay my fare to Victoria Falls!"

My apparent irrational act
Was examined (but after the fact)
By the local police.
It was not from caprice
That I goosed her and promptly got smacked.

I adore and I idolize Cher.
When she sings, there's no trouble or care
In my gay, happy soul.
What a singer! Her role
Is iconic. Her talent is rare.

The tennis pro played with a sore hand
Which soon started hurting some more, and
He thereby desisted
(His trainer insisted)
From swatting in practice aforehand.

In her very first game, Mia Farrow,
With the biceps you'd find on a sparrow,
Struck out each time at bat,
Four times total, and that
Is a feat called the golden sombrero.

The melon that Melanie gave us
Seemed dented; its side was concavous—
The result of a punch?
Well, we ate it for lunch.
Now we find it was rotted.  God save us!

I admire those Polar Bear nuts
Who endure shocking cold—that takes guts.
That curglaff they feel
Makes them jump out and squeal
As they rush to wrap blankets 'round butts.

Crowds holler with fervent hoorays.
Each banner boasts pride as it sways.
Paraders cheer braggingly
While Tom stands unflaggingly
Opposed to such blatant displays.

It's a breach of  the contract, I fear.
The wording's abundantly clear.
You didn't remember
To come in December.
You'll hear from my lawyer next year.

Plant classification was slated
For revision. There appeared a well-rated
And groundbreaking text
By Art Cronquist. What next?
Twenty years, and the system was dated.

Oddjob first  used his hat to deliver
A smashing hard blow to disshiver
A statue, to scare
Mr. Bond. But his glare
Couldn't make that cool master-spy quiver.

So your wife has three breasts? That's impressive!
And a lover as well? You're progressive!
Your nose (No, don't hide it!)
Has a twin there beside it.
All these things could be labeled accessive.

In Victoria, locals are fed
On Ashed Pyramid spread on their bread.
This cheese is the kind
That does not have a rind.
It is dusted with ashes instead.

Add to ambreic acid a base,
And an ambreate's left in its place.
That's a salt—in a niche
Next to ambrein, which
Is a fragrance perfumers embrace.

In a girl, there's no cause to bemoan,
Nor in flower, nor spirit, nor stone,
This particular plan.
But to say that a man
Is anorchid elicits a groan.

What exactly, precisely, was said
When you found Grandma lying in bed?
You had said that her eyes
Were of prominent size . . .?
Verbatim, please, Little Miss Red.

I was asking my daughter today
'Bout this guy she'd been dating, José.
"You loved this guy once.
Haven't seen him for months."
"Ancient history" is all she would say.

Baku is the town where I met,
At a mudfest, my greatest love yet.
That Azerbaijani
Named Konul — sweet Konnie! —
I swear I shall never forget.

It's a true, unassailable fact:
Sometimes honesty loses to tact.
If I say, "You look great!"
Though you're packing on weight,
I'm performing a balancing act.

He can rise from a midden, can Boris,
With the rose-laden fragrance of Floris.
His spacious orations
Are laced with quotations
From Juvenal, Ovid, and Horace.

Personality's often defined
Using all Big Five factors combined.
(I would list the traits now
Were they shortened somehow.)
These make all of us one of a kind.

Is it springtime that fills us with cheer,
Gets us out to the beach drinking beer?
Is it evenings in June?
Or the silvery moon?
No, it's August, eighth month of the year.

Times are hard, but we've nothing to fear.
If we save through the hard times and steer
A course fiscally sound,
We can turn it around
And be better off this time next year.

"For the cook, carriage driver, and maid,
He's the boss—has it made in the shade,"
Writes the hack.  Next the butler
Consults with the cutler
To buy an untraceable blade.

Bigmouth Morris last Monday declared:
"There's no fight, since my rival is scared!"
But the rival, named Boris,
Beat the hell out of Morris
Right after that viewpoint was aired.

Angelica: flavoursome root,
Which, in herbal concoctions, will suit
Most medicinal needs—
Not your typical weeds.
And it's good eaten candied, to boot.

An old lady who looks sort of cranky
Has this hat like an overgrown hanky.
If she said to me this:
"Davey, how 'bout a kiss?"
I would have to respond with "No, thanky!"

Sally, eating her salad, admits,
"Yes, I know these are not bacon bits.
They are made out of soy,
Not the real McCoy,
But since switching to these, my skirt fits!"

H2 in, O2 in: water out —
Electricity, too, without doubt.
Found in spacecraft and cars,
This may one day, on Mars,
Make us power and keep us from drought.

Unclaimed goods stay unclaimed — by design.
It's my "Bona Vacantia" sign.
You see, claimers can't find me.
The stuff here behind me,
In a month, by default, becomes mine.

We met casually (that is, by chance),
And I gave you a casual glance.
You did not seem to care,
With your casual air,
As you straightened your casual pants.

Our business is not doing well —
It's abysmal, in fact, gone to hell.
It is one of life's truths:
Wooden telephone booths
Are increasingly tricky to sell.

Dendrolagus: to me this beast's new.
It's a lowland-type tree-kangaroo.
Neither plumpish nor skinny,
It lives in New Guinea—
And in Queensland? You'll find it there too.

The tort that is based on rejection—
A marital midcourse correction
Where another's to blame—
Is now known by this name:
It's called alienation of affection.

"Pickled Flower Buds Gone!"  I will tape her
Account of the theft for my paper.
This Canaveral Mrs.
Cries, "What a crime this is!"
We'll name it "The Cape Caper Caper."

Is democracy now an illusion
Beset with bad faith and confusion?
Obsolete seems the plan
Of one vote for one man.
It's been tainted by fraud and collusion.

Our fine intellects we wouldn't foul
With fowl puns; we're as wise as an owl
About bird-hunting chaps,
Long called fowlers: with traps,
Arrows, dogs, or a rifle, they prowl.

Dalton Trumbo ran off to Vancouver
In order to flee, outmaneuver,
The H.U.A.C.
And still write absentee.
His allonym? "J. Edgar Hoover."

Where'd we sit if we didn't have chairs
To support 'take the weight off' affairs?
A posterior something,
A 'sitting on bum' thing,
A place for those soft derrières.

Conversation with you is a chore.
You're a nitpicking windbaggy bore!
You're so smug and pedantic
You're driving me frantic.
I'm rattled, freaked, frenzied, and more.

The Dramamine tablets I swallowed
Had little effect on what followed.
I was heaving like heck
On the slick, heaving deck.
Now my stomach feels empty and hollowed.

A man shot his gun in the air,
Just protesting that life is unfair.
And he deepened his frown
When the bullet came down—
He was hit in the you-can-guess-where.

A Papal Indulgence of yore
Meant your guilt (for a fee) was no more.
Carbon credits defray
Modern guilt — you still pay,
But the pope for our day is Al Gore.

When trying to stay off the booze,
Disulfiram's what you should use.
If you drink it will make
You regret your mistake—
When you vomit all over your shoes.

Fay, with her feminine wiles,
Had the young man elated—all smiles.
But how could he know
That's as far as she'd go?
Oh, the burden of youth and its trials!

I'd been dumped. Said my pal, "Don't lament.
Try a contact sport." So, off I went
To the gym, where I sparred;
Took a punch — rather hard.
My pal laughed: "No, it's chatrooms I meant."

Every newspaperman in the East
Calls me "Bigfoot," though I'm not that beast.
Each new column I write
Seems insightful and bright
And ensures that my rep is increased.

To impress a sweet lady, do this:
You should osculate—smooch with your miss.
But deosculate? Aaack!
Does that mean "take it back"?
No, it's just an old word for "to kiss."

This accountant is no CPA,
Though he hopes to become one some day.
The exams are a trial,
But they're surely worthwhile:
He'll track money for much better pay.

I demitted my office today;
Told my staff, faced the press, walked away.
Now I've lost all my perks.
Damn those mealy-mouthed jerks!
Why are thieving and lies not OK?

What is glottochronology?  It
Is the study of languages knit
By a common thread, tracing
The rate of replacing
The vocabs to guess when they split.

Prep the soil with these blades, curved and narrow,
Like Coyote's fine field over there.  Oh!
I thought you had heard —
He's stopped chasing that bird.
Wile E. farms now — it's his Acme harrow.

"Farewell!" he exclaimed, "And goodbye.
I'm so sad to be leaving. Don't cry.
How I'll miss your long legs,
And your bacon and eggs.
I shall picture you each time I fry."

Mr. Anderson took no malarky,
And often was snappish and snarky,
But with baseball his gig,
In both leagues he won big.
Not too bad for a grown man named Sparky!

A fuel cell that leaves no pollution,
And uses a boride solution,
Could replace gasoline
For a car that runs clean —
An automobile revolution.

I think Jesus would see a fine jest
In the way his believers contest.
Often push comes to shove
In religions of love —
At cross purposes sums it up best.

When shattered, these microclines shiver
Into green squarish chunks and won't sliver.
But amazonite
Is a name not quite right,
Since there's none near the Amazon River.

"Good as caz could be glossed 'piece of cake'."
"Yes, that's easy.  A guess I'll now make:
Would then caz be baked dough?"
"Though that's logical, no,
As it's cheese, if you please." "My mistake."

"Diagnosticate, Doc, diagnose,
So you'll know the appropriate dose
Of a drug that will save me!"
The answer he gave me:
"I'm doubtful." "Hell, try to come close!"

I have struggled for years with my weight.
Can't resist piling food on my plate.
So this op I've got planned:
Fit a tight gastric band
To lose half of this body I hate.

Steve's activeness thrills all his mates,
And his eagerness never abates:
"Crikey!" he'll shout,
"Now the only way out
Is the croc-based demise that awaits!"

"The defender now seeks a decree
Of absolvitor, granting 'that he
Be absolved'.  I ask, coyly,
The court to assoilzie
My client and let him go free."

Kenneth's gardener, at best, was half-assed.
"He was worthless, but that's in the past.
Now he's dead," Ken explains,
"Only bone dust remains.
On my roses, he's useful at last."

Aleatoricism: art based on chance.
It may not make much sense at first glance
(Or at second or third).
Though some call it absurd,
Chance Chants is a film I'd advance.

Birthday candles on cake?  She's too vain.
"They'll make light of my age," she'll complain.
She is hoity, it's true.
She will say this to you:
"I will never see toity again."

Ms Petula (wahine from Kula)
Strummed a uke as she danced a cool hula.
"I'm a Yalie, an Eli,"
She stated. Would she lie?
Not likely—she sang "Boola Boola."

If a clothes line should sag, don't despair;
You can keep those wet clothes in the air,
For a clothes prop will stop
Any ground-soiling drop
When its vee-shape notched end's brought to bear.

Oh, CRAP! — Good, I've got your attention.
Ecphonema's a tactic worth mention.
Cut an air of stagnation
With a sharp exclamation,
And break free of ennui—or ease tension.

"Fine feathers," said Dad, "make fine birds."
Those, alas, were his very last words.
So I spent his bequest
On becoming "best dressed".
Now I'm stylish: birds text me in herds.

In maths, complex fractions are trying,
But indeed, there's a truth underlying:
On the top or the bottom,
More fractions? They've got 'em.
Recursion brings cursing and sighing.

We were walking, and I found  a dime.
So did Freddy. I thought up a rhyme
Using dime, rhyme and ready,
And then so did Freddy.
He equals me — yes, every time.

Attacks?  And our borders are lax?
Politicians will claim those are facts.
Though the pols cite these stressors,
There are no aggressors.
Instead of attacks there's a tax.

"What does apathy mean? I don't care!"
(Stony silence) "What's honesty? Rare!"
(Still no laughs—what a shock.)
"Here's a good one: Knock! Knock!"
(Lord, that comic is dying up there.)

Many states form this wonderful nation.
Put together, it's quite a creation.
We aggregate things
Into one and it brings
A collection, an agglomeration.

Ammodramus, a genus of sparrows,
Features several with tails sharp as arrows.
From the fens where they skulk
They eat grass seeds in bulk
And snatch bugs by the dawn and dusk scarrows.

Elmer's cheating and breaking his vow,
So they're having this terrible row:
Elsie's sure that he strayed,
"Cut the bull—you got laid!"
He's been thinking of pleading "mad cow".

Anchovies on hot dogs? Now, Frank,
I'll be honest—that recipe stank.
Really, Frank, I must say:
Throw those wieners away,
'Cause those franks, Frank? Quite frankly, they're rank.

If an action cannot be divided
Into smaller parts, some have decided
That an acteme's its name.
But it might be the same
As a concept that Zeno derided.

"No, don't!" yelled the captain, aghast,
To a deckhand who acted too fast.
Off the edge fell what looked
Like the anchor unhooked,
But 'twas ancoral ballast he cast.

Meg's mum would say, wearily, "Meg,
Stop that whining, dear child, now I beg."
But if still the child whinged
Then the words that impinged
Were, "Do you have a bone in your leg?"

Exhibitionism usually starts
With dysfunctional psyches and hearts:
Getting sexual kicks
From malevolent tricks,
By displaying one's own private parts.

A clunker is something that fails,
Never gets any wind in its sails.
It's a flop or a mess,
Like my plan for success,
Which, I guess, will soon ride off the rails.

An arm of the famous UN,
FAO as it's known, is where men
And women are meeting
With hopes of defeating
World problems of hunger, but when?

Feather beds can seem soft and sublime
When they're new — like stuffed pillows; but I'm
Rather reckoning that
They will feel hard and flat
As the feathers compress over time.

Said Picasso, "This flounder is ace!
Yes, box jellyfish move with great grace,
But I can't see the use in
A cubomedusan —
It lacks eyes and a nose to misplace."

"In this book, there's a word," remarked Gloria,
"And it must mean what I've got: Clitoria."
When I said, "Darling mine,
It's a tropical vine,"
This deflated her sexual euphoria.

I'm conserving my energy, son.
I've got plans. Don't assume that I've none.
I'm no lazy-ass slouch,
Lying here on this couch —
I'm just storing up strength for a run.

I eye-witnessed a gang hit and so
Now the Mafia hunts me. Oh, no!
Seems the one chance I've got
To avoid getting shot:
Into Witness Protection I go.

Dull green cabbage is one of those vegges
That is shredded or cut up in wedges
To be boiled with corned beef;
Then it brings on the grief
Alimentary—you'll hide behind hedges!

As producer of Beckett's last play,
Please talk to the cast about pay.
With no cash in the till,
Tell the actors you will
Cast about for an alternate way.

When the metal's so hot that it glows
And then melts (becomes fluid and flows),
Then it's ready to cast.
Pour it quick, thick and fast,
Into moulds, to be shaped as you chose.

Shun the dog hobble: poisonous shrub.
Don't let pets use its leaves as their grub.
This advice bears repeatin':
"MAY BE FATAL IF EATEN!"
Best beaten to death with a club.

Galileo advised his Aunt Janet:
"When the night sky is clear, we must scan it.
With my celatone here,
Jovian moons will make clear
Lines of longitude here on this planet."

The leaf of a pig is called flare.
I should give you some clue as to where
I am talking about,
So, to banish all doubt,
It's the fat round the kidneys I share.

Now their once-blissful coupling is failing,
Like a mis-driven train that's derailing.
That "heaven-made" marriage?
An off-the-rails carriage
That's leaving the tracks, with tears trailing.

Our ale's aged in casks (never tanks)
And our sarnies are thicker than planks.
The critics agree
That our new brasserie
Makes gourmands and gourmets all give thanks.

He explored and he drew back the curtain
On regions unknown or uncertain,
On peoples exotic,
On customs erotic:
The Captain Sir Richard F. Burton.

Every winter nut farmers employ
Mounds of beehives to help (not annoy).
They promote pollination
And aid with inflation
Of crops sure to bring almond joy.

Go sit down. Calm yourself. Don't get pushy.
There's no reason to work. This job's cushy.
Set yourself in a chair
And act devil-may-care.
But prepare to get sores on your tushy.

A sign, E-A-T, meant our quest
For refreshment while traveling west
Was (for then) at an end,
But we couldn't pretend
That this greasy spoon's grub had impressed.

So you think habañeros too plain,
And you want to eat something insane.
Try some ghost peppers. "YEOW!"
Are you happier now?
Do you find that they cause enough pain?

Green members of Congress declare
We should care for our water and air:
We're befouling our Earth!
They point out, without mirth,
We have no other planets to spare.

Grandma knitted a sweater, in which
She included a nice cable stitch.
For this lovely design
Where two lines intertwine
She used purple-hued yarn that looks rich.

What a biogeographer does
Is determine where living things was.
"How many, and where?"
Are his everyday care.
And why does he do this?  Becuz.

That live wire—downed and sparking—can burn you,
But of course, that won't really concern you,
Nor high voltage's clout
Rouse your fears. I've no doubt
When it floors you, you'll laugh and cry, "Durn you!"

When a president makes a decision,
It's regarded by some with derision.
Have the disparate voices
Affected my choices?
No way.  I stayed true to my vision.

A student of dental pathology
Has to study and grasp the biology
Of the mouth, gums, and teeth,
And the structures beneath,
And must master the latest technology.

There once was a lady, in fiction,
Who had an unusual affliction:
She emitted a shriek
When she started to speak,
And insisted it aided her diction.

I really must thank Dr. Quinn
For the wonderful health that I'm in.
He prescribes what I eat
(Lots of veggies, no meat),
And my celibacy, causing chagrin.

Is a culture so terribly strange
Whose traditions are subject to change?
Some begin, others end.
Evolution's our friend,
As it helps to extend custom's range.

"Who's up for Charades or I Spy?"
(My party was starting to die.)
"I could twist some balloons"—
"You should crank up the tunes!"
So I turned up the volume real high…

Animation means "bringing to life".
In the world of cartoons, this is rife.
 But beware my friend Tom, he's
 A lover of zombies
And animates ghouls to cause strife.

In British Columbia (B.C.):
That is where I would now like to be.
I bought my first Hoover
In downtown Vancouver,
And went on a vacuuming spree.

Yes, we used to be joined at the hip,
But our romance in time lost its grip.
As a couple, we flunked.
Now our lives are disjunct,
And today he just gives me the pip.

Minor surgery — what a great plan
To improve every droop that you can!
An enhancive procedure
Is bound to mislead your
Dumb boyfriends in back of the van.

It's a greenish, gelatinous goo
Some folks think is delicious, but, eww...
It lies 'neath the top
Turtle shell. Use this glop
As a calipash garnish in stew.

Devolution's about distribution
Of power. With fair execution,
A state that accedes
To its regional needs
Achieves peace and avoids revolution.

Mother Goose knows a fine-fettled cat
Who fiddles "Hey Diddle." By that,
She may mean a twiddle
That's bowed from a fiddle
Or nonsense sung long before scat.

"England's blessed with a really smart way,"
Professed Bagehot, "to govern today.
Neither Commons nor King
Can accomplish a thing,
Unless both are agreed it's O.K."

Of reasons you think you've grown fatter,
It's really quite clear:
You're esurient, dear.
You're a hog; that's the crux of the matter.

Aneretic prescriptions are scary.
They're destructive. How much? Perhaps very.
If we take one, what dies?
Will it cause our demise?
Take the pill if you must, but be wary.

"I'm committed to Caesar.  All hail!"
Cried a Roman, too eager for bail;
But his loyalty left
Him no license for theft,
And he's just been committed to gaol.

Some creatures we purposely train
So their wildness is tamed, in the main.
We domesticate just
To get food through the trust
Of these beasts. They're retained and then slain.

The amnion cushions the fetus;
It'll break, he'll emerge and will meet us.
The baby's the sweetest;
That time is the neatest!
As a teen, though, he'll not even greet us.

Some intestinal ducts are chylific:
Their function is very specific.
They create milky chyle
(That is, lymph, fat, and bile) —
Aren't digestive descriptions horrific?

Since the Mets were so bad it was scary,
Harry Chiti was right to feel wary.
This poor catcher was shamed:
Who's the guy not then named
To complete this sad trade? It was Harry!

I've arthritis (both hips); it's a strain.
Without saying, this does connote pain.
I have trouble with stairs,
And those deep comfy chairs.
There's just one thing that helps: I complain.

See my walker, young man? Pound for pound
It's the best aid for getting around.
Check the streamlined appeal—
There's a cowl for each wheel
So it's aerodynamically sound.

The cockroach is scared of the rat
Who, in turn, is afraid of the cat,
Who dreads dogs, who fear men,
Who avoid wives... (it then
Comes full circle)... who screech, "Roaches! Scat!"

Cryptologists take diverse roads
Of approach—mathematical modes—
To solve many a mystery.
They even make history
By cracking the world's toughest codes.

Huge tears filled her eyes, drowned her cheek.
"Just a two!", Kali cried, oozing pique.
"Of the girls the sheikh's had
 In the harem, you're baaad.
 And thus ends my review — my critique."

She's a waitress dressed up as a bunny,
Serves your drinks, deals your cards, takes your money;
Playboy started the trend,
Now, thank God, at an end:
Dressing girls up as rabbits ain't funny.

When an alphabet's music to me,
It has A B C D E F G.
Seven letters get swirled
In a musical world—
What commotion, if A went to Z!!!

In the medieval kingdom of Kent,
St. Aethelberht fostered content
When he codified laws,
(Anglo-Saxon the cause)
With the Church's advice and consent.

When my speech was entirely attended
By silence, I knew I'd offended.
When you speak at a funeral,
An offer (remuneral)
To the widow is not recommended.

Our moon, when compared to the sun,
Is in size the diminutive one.
But when viewed in the skies,
Sun and moon match in size.
(A coincidence rarely outdone.)

Aloysius is very ambitious;
A Yale PhD his fond wish is,
But his graduate thesis
Has many faked pieces.
His data are phony, factitious.

For our home, we don't use the word doors.
We say "entryways," grander than yours:
Double-wide, solid oak—
Lord, she's spending me broke—
Next, Carrara instead of mere floors.

Cure of souls — sacral role of the curate.
KPIs: Sunday bums-on-seats (pew rate);
Ounces (wine) they consumed;
Number (altar boys) groomed;
Baptised converts (ex-heathen-and-Jew rate).

You calumnious rogue! Your foul lies
Have besmirched my repute in men's eyes!
Without one jot of shame
You have soiled my good name
With the worst filth a mind can devise.

Gypsy skirts, spirits free, boho ways
Are a floaty, free, fun fashion phase.
Deviate from the norm:
That's the way to conform.
"Come on, we all do it these days!"

An X-ray we took of Aunt Stella
Showed a bone that is called a fabella.
It was easy to see,
Toward the back of her knee—
Not in front, near her kneecap (patella).

Well, a fungus, if hitching a trip,
Will adhere with a thick flattened tip.
Hyphal branch will attach
(Appressorium, natch!),
And it clutches so tight, it won't slip.

The Victoria's Secret clerk snickers
As gum-booted hicks in their slickers
Ask to see the selection,
For Daisy's inspection,
Of satin and lace camiknickers.

The bill-board on board of a ship,
By securing the cuspidate tip
Of the anchor, aweighing,
Prevents it from swaying
And causing the timbers to chip.

When I braid Amy's hair I attempt
To ensure she does not look unkempt.
I weave plaits—one or two;
It's the least I can do.
Seems her mother pretends she's exempt.

This scene is just drenched with a sweet
Glow, awash with a warmth. It's so neat
To be part of this meeting,
If ever so fleeting.
This meet, I repeat, is a treat!

The attic at Wit's End contains
An enormous collection of trains.
There's track in it too,
Like the station at Crewe,
So the Phelpses can play when it rains.

Acestes, a man who'll inspire,
Shot an arrow so fast it caught fire,
So that when you orate,
What you forcefully state
Is Acestes's arrow. Admire!

I told friends (who had called to invite us
To dine) that my wife had colpitis.
This she'd told me to say
In that very same way,
And not use the more known vaginitis.

She's a safe and suburbanite stranger
To you, but I'd never exchange 'er.
Stop dissing my missus
As cookies and kisses—
Her byword in bed is still Danger.

Carousing means "having much fun",
Say, drinking till night-time is done.
But make sure you eschew
That Dudweiser brew
Or you'll wish that you'd never begun!

I love words; I can't leave them alone.
Moving letters, I make them my own.
And with this kind of change
To the "Amazon range"
I create my own "anagram zone."

My name's Atlas, no doubt that I'm strong!
I've been hefting the heavens so long!
For their books full of maps,
Those cartographer chaps
Use my name, without paying—that's wrong!

We turned woods into cotton and peas
To promote agricultural ease.
Now we manage the land —
Agroforestry's planned
So that farmers can plant around trees.

Authoritatively he spoke,
Commanding us: "Throw off your yoke!
Make the logical choice,
And don't follow one voice!"
So we listened and forced him to choke.

Though you've plenty of beauty and charm,
I'll depart now in haste and alarm—
If that hulk bringing drinks
Is your beau, then methinks
I'm about to face bodily harm.

Your average music commissioner
May sometimes employ an auditioner
To check that the skill
Of the soloist will
Not be grounds for the crowd to throw fish on 'er.

When our priest, a fine singer's descanting,
His 4ths, 5ths, and 6ths leave me panting.
I hold dear and revere
Every clear, defined tier.
Use your ear, can't you hear, he's in chanting!

That contest of marathon eating,
Long and arduous, found me competing
With others who ate
From a bottomless plate
Of spiced sausage, and now we're repeating.

"Stop your drinking!" Brunhilda will beg
Of her beer-bellied son-in-law, Gregg.
"He has drunk so much beer,
It's just fitting," I sneer,
"That his abdomen's shaped like a keg!"

An asthmatic old fellow named Clem
Was cursed by great masses of phlegm.
"Ahem, ahem (spit),
Ahem, ahem (spit),
Ahem, ahem (spit), and ahem!"

O'Neill teaches us to be wary
Of stokers who tend to be hairy.
Although Mildred, in white,
Wants to do what is right,
She finds Yank is too apelike and scary.

Abimelech's three kings or four.
(It's hard to be sure. Maybe more.)
One more Biblical name
Of no noteworthy fame.
And rhyming them all? Quite a chore!

New York Governor Spitzer's wide range
Of support, he discovered, would change
By reversal; sex bought
Led to Eliot caught.
(Politicians who fool us?  How strange.)

I am frequently down on all fours,
Though I'll gladly stand up to push doors.
With my paws on the ground,
I'm a tough little hound,
In position for opening drawers.

Was it Mona, you reckon, who chose
To look cryptic? Or do you suppose
Leonardo da Vinci
Just gave her a pinch? She
Perhaps had a Code id her doze?

Harvard sophomore scholars—rejoice!
Ann Yale's Deturs return her stilled voice.
Edward Hopkins' largesse
Lauds scholastic success:
Each is given a book of his choice.

We're all nuts, so we'll all persevere
In this queue for a Star Trek premiere.
Ah, but somewhere out there
Is a flick, we'll all swear,
Worth a wait of a full cosmic year.

I've got looks, dough and guys, glad to say.
I've three boyfriends named Dick. Though I may
Not know which guy to choose,
Would  I ever refuse
An embarrassment of Riches?  No way.

I'll say this — and I'm very emphatic —
With Schmeck's tech drawing skills I'm ecstatic.
Detailed graphics and charts
Show how all design parts
Are related; he's diagrammatic.

Geophilic, that's me, through and through:
I love earth, mud and soil. Do you too?
Its warm feeling, its smell,
And its flavour as well
I adore — as we worms tend to do.

Into what, you may ask, should we log?
An AAA server's top dog.
It checks our IDs,
Lets us burn MP3s,
And looks out for the CPU hog.

Single guinea pig? No, say the Swiss.
That's a practice considered remiss.
Having one cavy only
Would make it feel lonely.
Each rodent needs mates for its bliss.

If an animal grows a long byssus,
It will seldom receive many kisses.
I refer to the mussel,
A beast with no hustle;
I doubt that he knows what he misses.

Cross the critical pressure to go
To the region where bubbles don't show
In a liquid when heated
Past Tc! No one cheated.
Gas or liquid? One fluid, you know.

Aphephobia: that's why I cry,
"If you touch me once more, it's good-bye!
Blow a kiss? That's OK
If you're ten feet away,
But your hugs make me curl up and die!"

It's jetsam if jettisoned out
From a ship in distress and, no doubt,
Cargo lost to the sea
Or the ship's own debris
Is called flotsam if floating about.

Every day I make sure to begin
With a breakfast of corn flakes and gin.
It may taste a bit weird,
But it helps keep my beard
A lot cleaner—no milk down my chin!

Now here is a riddle to try:
Just when is an eye not an eye?
The answer is clear:
When the eye is anear,
Which means it is very close by.

My mom, Edith, will argue that she's
Been for years eating peas with some ease.
But my aunt says, at six,
Peas she'd instantly nix,
That for each one she'd swallow, she'd seize.

A bagnio (a brothel to you)
Had an animal musical crew,
Where eleven baboons
Sang lewd tunes from saloons,
While a twelfth played along on kazoo.

Aged four, maybe five, was young Meg
When an older boy asked for a gleg —
A quick look — at her bum.
She refused. Sucked her thumb.
All he glimpsed was the top of her leg.

It grows in your old copper urn,
A green, acrogenic wood fern,
A blossomless plant
That remains flower scant,
Which is natural, experts discern.

He will tell you enormity ought
To mean "wickedness". Then, with a snort,
"You can't use it for size:
That's enormousness!" cries
The pedant. (He's wrong in that thought.)

An American went to Pwllheli
To try out their tea bread and jelly.
"Wow, I love bara brith:
How it sticks to the teeth,
And the fullness I feel in my belly!"

When a cell wants to leave in a flash,
It will wiggle these hairs with a splash.
Every cilium is used.
You should not get confused:
On your eye, the same word means "a lash".

An expatriate abdal named Grant
Moved to Persia, and now, with a chant,
In a skirt with a flare
And his arms in the air,
He majestically whirls till he can't.

Relativity's theorems delight;
Mass increases with speed of your flight.
And a dieter's ploy's
Watching avoirdupois:
Would he rather go faster than light?

No Frenchman was ever as smart
As that clever old chappie Descartes.
His coordinate system
Finds things if you've missed 'em:
X over, Y up, on the chart.

"Taking turns": the alternative way
Is "al-ter-nately";  that's in UK.
But across the great Pond,
Though our lingo's a bond,
It's the al-ternate meaning they say.

I'm a horseman — a good one, of course;
It's a question of skill, not of force.
I set out an equestrian,
Returned a pedestrian —
An hour or so after the horse.

A walloper (dock), name of Feagles,
Smiled, "This dock hand will soar with the eagles
When I offload these chumps,"
But he soon got his lumps.
He was trying to smuggle illegals.

'Twas around the year 453,
While the Anglos enjoyed morning tea:
The Romans were booted
By Saxons who looted.
Anglo-Saxon they all came to be.

"My tick is OK," said my clock,
"But something's still wrong with my tock!
Our old clocksmith eschew;
Get a shrink quick, please do!
I'm wound up and could use a head doc."

The tough john was demanding his dough back;
The rough pimp was demanding his ho back.
While they were discussing,
The dealer was fussing —
Demanding his coke (that's his blow) back.

Arthrobotrys, at times, produce snares
That trap roundworms much thinner than hairs.
As the hyphae are cinched
The wee creatures are pinched,
Taking nematodes quite unawares.

The games that we've lost in the past
Are the reason we're standing dead last.
With a record so stellar,
We dwell in the cellar,
Unsurpassed in our losses amassed.

What a waste!  I pursued and I caught
Becky Sue, but she's not what I thought.
Barking up the wrong tree
Got her married to me —
My mistake.  A divorce is now sought.

The teacher said Bradley had fabulated
Too many stories. She'd tabulated
Tales in her log —
Dubbed Brad's Homework v. Dog —
Which explains how Brad's labrador Abdul ate it.

You're abusing my spousal largesse
When you're spending de trop (in excess),
Going over our limits.
My bank account's grim; it's
A balance near zero—a mess!

With an English moustache you bestow
On your face a distinct British glow.
With tips waxed but not curled,
You're a man of the world.
It says, "Pip, pip, old bean. Cheerio!"

Some seedless, nonflowering plants
Are attempting to grow up my pants.
Are they ferns on a journey?
They seem kind of ferny.
I guess I should give them a chance.

Is that cap there your cylinder head?
At full stroke, does it swell, go deep red?
When it pumps up and down,
Does your piston's hard crown
Stay well-oiled, or start grinding instead?

Because Gabe suffers grave alcolasia,
His gait will resemble abasia.
He's constantly plastered.
Says Mom: "Jail the bastard!"
His brother suggests euthanasia.

The name that was chosen for you
At your birth is your given name, true.
It is also your first name
And Christian name (worst name
To call it if you are a Jew).

An apple-cheeked lassie named Milly
Got fatigued from these questions so silly:
"Are those red cheeks you have
Just a rash?  Need some salve?"
So she always gave answers quite chilly.

Disulfiram has no effect,
Unless it is booze you select.
Drinking rum, wine, or beer,
Very flushed you'll appear.
You'll feel sick; you'll throw up; you'll be wrecked.

For a year, it's a larva—the mayfly—
So when hatched, it's a hip hip hooray-fly.
But it's really a sad fly;
Short-lived is this shadfly.
That's why we have named it the dayfly.

Agriculturists often like green,
The hue of a lovely ripe bean.
They work in the garden;
Their dirt you will pardon,
On tasting a ripe tangerine.

The fibbing-match starts sharp at eight.
Fifteen rounds, with The Brute (who we hate)
v. The Kid (who we love),
Though when push comes to shove,
Gonna bet on The Brute. (Sorry, mate.)

Anatosaurus? This dino's no more.
As the Trachodon, 'twas known before.
Tall as forty feet grown,
This duckbill's now known
As Edmontosaurus of yore.

Although taste buds may find them a dilly,
Those Mexican peppers are silly.
Ya know that you oughter
Have plenty of water.
Can something so hot be called chile?

Anno Domini's known as AD,
"The year of Our Lord", don't you see?
So the year I was born
On a cold frosty morn
Might just be called anno JG.

The ad cost us six thousand bucks,
But the cost of each mille is the crux.
So for twelve thousand views,
That's five hundred we lose
For each thousand who know that it sucks.

Stan, a fan, was obsessive, they say —
Loved the Stones, went to hear that group play.
But the band he upstaged.
That got Jagger enraged;
The bad fanboy got carried away.

In tones that were icy with frost,
My doctor remarked, "Does the cost
Of your endless complaint
Not encourage restraint?
You're severely amyctic. Get lost!"

The apiary kept near the trees
Is home to the family bees.
Except for the honey,
We'd have no more money
For biscuits or meds against fleas.

Yellow blooms, with your delicate shape,
Yielding oil from your seed, like the grape:
Why the name of canola?
Is it just to console a
Consumer who's frightened of rape?

The young woman informed the librarian,
"In another two weeks I'll be marryin'.
Got a book that'll say
How to cook birds of prey?
'Cause my beau says he's eagle-itarian."

If you're wearing a car coat, you are
Very likely to look like a star.
It's the three-quarter coat
Fashionistas promote—
Not the paint that you spray on your car!

I've a hundred and one things to do,
And minutes for leisure are few.
My day is so busy
I feel rather dizzy.
If you're wanting a date — join the queue!

In the States, there are ciders you meet
That are labeled as hard or as sweet.
The hard one's fermented,
So drink it, contented;
The sweet one's just pressed, no deceit.

Uncle Gary, who lives down in Devon,
Personifies joke-tellers' heaven.
When he laughs, he will roar —
And so loudly guffaw,
He'll explode to guffive, six and seven!

A chemtrail's a trail in the sky
That's left by a plane flying by.
Conspiracists say
It's a secretive way
To control folks — but that's just a lie.

Bertha's bosoms made breast milk superiorly,
Though they barely protruded anteriorly—
That is, outwardly stuck.
That was Bertha's good luck;
She felt bottles fed babies inferiorly.

The urologist acted surprised
When he looked at my eyes and advised,
"Since your pupils are yellow,
Your bladder, my fellow,
Must quickly be catheterized."

A bovine's attracted a claque
Who are awed by the hump on his back.
They've been making this newbie,
A zebu, and zoo be
The subjects about which they yak.

Your recumbent bike's fast and you pass
Other bikers while saving on gas.
A.S.S. makes demands:
You must steer with your hands
At a height above that of your ass.

A Bengali who's febrile and weak
Finds it's getting much harder to speak.
When his tongue starts to chap
And it cleaves, he thinks, "Crap!
I've got agrom—I feel like a freak!"

For the warm-blooded human, this term (ick!)
Means slicing his homeothermic
Integument thin
So a book's bound with skin:
Bibliopegy, anthropodermic.

They are mustering Company C,
And the soldiers on hand? Thirty-three,
But there should be one more,
So the first sergeant swore:
"Go and hire a fagot!" (That's me!)

"I must cancel the concerts I planned;
Hope the rest of the band understand!"
The poor pianist wailed,
"With these nodes I'm assailed,
I've got Bouchard's all over my hand!"

I, just now, had an almost-collision,
Caused by floaters invading my vision—
Roving squiggles and spots
(Now I've aged, I've got lots)—
Can't describe them with any precision.

Our absolute altitude's taken
By machines that are rarely mistaken.
Here in darkness complete,
I'm advised, "Seven feet."
Hope the passengers don't see me shakin'.

The penguin, a comical bird,
Had a name that is now rarely heard,
And, although not polite,
It described him just right.
It was arsefoot, an old sailor word.

Once a crookbacked old man in my store,
As he left, dropped his keys on the floor.
So, as manners dictated,
I retrieved them and waited,
With a hunch he'd be back through the door.

F.a.d.i.n.g. f.a.d.
i.n.g. f.a.d.i.n.g.
The print's growing paler;
This lim's looking frailer:
F.a.d.i.n.g... Can you see?

Brand of many a household appliance,
And commune of great self-reliance
That was founded by Germans
With positive sermons:
Amana—both social and science.

There's a hill that I think's rather neat.
It rises to eight hundred feet,
Formed by glacial motion.
I haven't a notion
Why it came to be called Arthur's Seat.

Once the lad she'd been eyeing matured,
Connie planned his seduction: she lured
Vin away from his bike,
Saying, "This, you will like."
The convincement of Vince was assured.

When I'm anxious and tense to the max,
I don't seek panaceas from quacks.
I shed all of my troubles
While soaking in bubbles;
My bath—that is where I relax.

Peace and quiet is just what I need,
Not your rude pack of rugrats on speed.
They're not welcome, I say.
No! Please take them away!
They will chaoize life, guaranteed.

Don Ameche, his mom's pride and joy,
Had success but it didn't annoy
His kid brother, Jim,
Since good luck followed him
Playing "Jack...All-American Boy."

Of course, man, acourse means "of course",
As I see in my Oxford-made source.
It is also quite true:
It means "naturally", too.
(Acourse, this is no tour de force.)

When Pa got his luggage in Reno,
He found he'd forgotten his Beano.
He lit up the joint,
But more to the point,
His win(d) emptied out the casino.

A crucible's sort of a pot,
Although not one you'd bang as a tot.
It's a specialized kettle
(Ceramic or metal)
And used when things really get hot.

The baidarka's a skin-covered boat
Aleuts used in regions remote.
Off Alaska they plied
Coastal waters with pride—
One of many such peoples of note.

I'm sorry to bother you, but
I just heard you misuse (you think: "What?!")
Trademarked Band-Aid to mean
"Adhesive bandage": that clean
Piece of gauze on some tape for your cut.

Today I was really impressed
At the rate Bessie's food can digest.
She ate apples at ten;
They were broken down, then
She excreted the pips on request.

"I pine for a hookup with Beth."
"Kev, keep dreaming.  More likely, your death
Will come first, so don't wait
For some dubious date.
She's not into you.  Don't hold your breath."

Define words with cr-?  It's a snap!
But too late do I notice the trap.
Though I sought splendid verse
I got awful or worse;
Seems that all I can think of is crap.

They always end up being downers,
So I strive to avoid these encounters.
A chance meeting's no crime,
But the problem is I'm
Xenophobic, and they're out-of-towners.

We were wed in a modest stone chapel
Neath blossoms of cherry and apple.
The bride's papa carried
A shotgun. We married.
(It's a weapon with which one can't grapple.)

Dalmatians are white with black dots—
Dogs that live in unusual spots.
In the firehouse, they're pets;
It's as good as it gets.
They get love, food, and exercise—lots!

The soil we call gelisol's  known
For including a permafrost zone.
Above this formation
A cryoturbation
(From thawing and freezing) is shown.

The cryoturbation, we're learning,
Is caused by the act of frost churning:
The soil's top layer
Each year's a conveyer
Of freezing and thawing and turning.

Vapor (mercury); tube made of glass;
Fluorescent coat. Current will pass
Through the vapor. UV
Light's emitted — you'll see
Brilliant white from fluorescence. Kick-ass!

Joe Conservative says what he thinks,
And he doesn't use drugs, never drinks.
He is antirevolutionary
But pro-executionary—
"Kill the radicals! Death to the pinks!"

A priest, making sausage in haste,
Fell in, and was ground to a paste.
Though once a fine fella,
He's now mortadella,
And beckons to catholic taste.

My life's an assortment of grays;
There are tans, off-whites, café au laits.
It's drabbish, it's dull,
There's no core, only hull.
There's no there there, there's only a haze.

Glenn Miller!  He got in the mood
To come closer, in music: Imbued
With close-harmony's sound,
Those sweet saxes abound
In romance, by a jazz line construed.

"There's no fenugreek left for my curry!
Now it's ruined!" "There's no need to worry,
Get stressed or get flustered:
Maple syrup, or mustard,
Or fennel might work, in a hurry."

Need more thrust? Here's a fine booster rocket.
Once it's pushed you aloft, you undock it
So it falls to the ocean.
You've sped up your motion.
(You'd have crashed had you failed to unlock it.)

Ah Puch, Mayan god of the dead,
Is portrayed with an owlish head.
He is corpselike, wears bells,
And is lord of the hells.
You hear screeching? You're finished, it's said.

While the mogul who married Celeste
Is impressed by the size of each breast,
And her curves make him glad,
He can't help feeling sad
That her brain's not as big as her chest.

Our whole boiler room crew's hard at work
Making calls for this arrogant jerk.
Though he's far from respectable
(And loud), he's electable,
Despite the man's know-it-all smirk.

If your laundry soap's giving you troubles,
Or the head on your beer often doubles,
Agents called antifoaming
Send your cares all a-roaming,
Along with Don Ho's "Tiny Bubbles".

Number eighteen is argon (don't yawn).
It's inert, so no compounds can spawn.
Someone opened the glass
And let loose all the gas!
Now all traces of argon are gone.

Her teachers sighed, "What will she be?
Her brain is the size of a pea."
Then she married a Yank
With a stash in the bank.
Her face was her fortune, you see.

Super party, but... boy, what a mess!
I'll help clean, but I can't in this dress.
Let me first change my clothes,
Get a mop (and a hose?),
Then the damage we'll start to assess.

It hardly occurs to the young
That to speak with a glib double-tongue
Makes each a damned liar,
Cast into the fire
From which their duplicity'd sprung.

A pernicious event, sad to see,
Was reversed by infusions of tea:
The explorers were doomed
Till they boiled and consumed
Arborvitae, a curative tree.

If you've got a weak ticker, beware,
And when shovelling snow, do take care.
I just finished my drive;
Now I'm scarcely alive.
The whole process was rough, a real bear.

One must bowl the red ball, and not kick it,
Towards the batsman in front of the wicket.
If you bowl it just right,
It won't fly out of sight
(Which would cost you six runs, playing cricket).

The time's running out for him fast,
Though he's started to catch on at last
That he's a dead man
Who's still walking. The plan
Is that his time with us is now past.

For our plan, we will have to ensure
That all members' commitments endure.
Harry's disposable
Since he's elozable —
Subject to flattery's lure.

At the Round Dance is where they dance slow, Tate,
Or caper in circles.  Let's go, Tate!
We'll whirl in conjunction
At that social function,
Displaying the way we corotate.

I wish to describe how I feel:
Ecstatic, erotic, what zeal!
Being frenzied and frantic,
Feeling more than romantic...
 "Dionysian?" Yes, that's ideal!

A duster of feathers am I.
You're entitled to ask, "Really? Why?"
I'll explain if I must:
I'm a tool to brush dust —
Fully-feathered but not meant to fly.

It's a detour not caused by construction,
An electrical signal obstruction.
In order to see it
You must EKG it —
Aberrant ventricular conduction.

For Gayle, I had such a fixation.
What started as preoccupation
Had turned to obsession
Then stalking aggression.
They're booking me down at the station.

From the heavens, the hand of God came.
Then His voice boomed, "Is evil your game?
Take a look at my thumb.
I'm detruding some scum
Down to Hell.  Will your fate be the same?"

Cocainism isn't a fiction,
But a fairly unpleasant affliction
That you get if you hose
Too much snow up your nose:
It's the upshot of coke (sniff) addiction.

He said, "Hey! Come and dine at my house,
Though the meal is bare-bones."  But his spouse
Really gives me a scare;
Would she really serve bear?
I would rather eat pheasant or grouse.

My husband's a train buff named Ab;
His knowledge of steam is just fab.
This champion of rail,
And of trains' holy grail,
Posts his cronies in limitless gab.

With dropsicalness, Ray is inflated,
And the swelling has hardly abated
Through attempted repair
By his medical care.
With edema he's weighted, dilated.

Though he won't have the use of a cleaver,
He'll work himself into a fever.
And he won't give a dam
That he's made a log jam
In the Cam; he's a true eager beaver.

A bad beat is what happens in poker
When your rival, with cards mediocre,
Beats incredible odds,
Thanks to poker's cruel gods.
You were sure you'd won big—now you're broker.

From my snooze, I awoke to the stews'
Cries for women and children, in queues.
Was I on the Titanic?
What could cause all this panic?
It was Spam on our Carnival cruise.

The music was quite inharmonic;
The dissonant chords were no tonic.
All the notes were ajar—
Left my brain with a scar—
Mental pain can be stereophonic!

What the hell's an affinity card?
To find out doesn't take Scotland Yard.
A part of each charge,
Whether little or large,
Goes to charity—quite avant-garde.

The sheep in the meadow stand baaing,
While goats, nibbling grass, stand there maaing,
Just grazing and gazing—
I find it amazing—
While rabbits are ma-ing and pa-ing.

No grim accusation is baseless:
For a mask, Lecter skins a guard faceless.
Eating livers and lights,
Lecter sleeps  well of nights.
Unregenerate, he will die graceless.

It's a world filled with hatred, aflame;
"Love thy neighbor" no longer — our shame.
Citing various Lords,
We beat plowshares to swords:
What a blasphemous use of God's name.

Ah, the em dash —  that flowing stroke I
Can't resist, for it helps my words fly!
See 'em dash from my pen
In long lines — though not when
I am using my keyboard — well, try!

Count to "tenth" and one more, then you get
The next ordinal number; and let
This be voiced as "eleventh"
(Not "third", "fifth", or "seventh")
In your sequence, or series, or set.

Air your lungs; it will do you no good—
Can't imagine whyever it should.
All that piercing profanity!
Some question your sanity.
You're bound to be misunderstood.

Baro't saya's the Philippine dress
That the women can wear to impress.
But the caste system's stark:
Mine's from pounded white bark —
Hers, from silk which I'd love to caress.

Our First Lady is bright like a zinnia:
The loveliest in this millennia.
But listen dear FLOTUS
And take proper notice.
They might send you back to Slovenia.

The student was more than perplexed;
The meaning seemed clear — she was vexed!
Her previous thesis
Was allegoresis
Should be used to interpret the text.

Let me tell you the rumor I heard,
Though I'm sure it's completely absurd:
Queen Leda of Sparta
(We thought she was smarta)
Began an affair with a bird.

When Count Dracula smacked the ball fat,
All fans heard was a squeak and a SPLAT!
The Desmodus he chose
When he hit for the "Hose"
Was an unlucky vampire bat.

That you ought to be scared of the rattle
Of a diamondback's nothing but prattle.
With a rattlesnake, friend,
Check the opposite end.
What will lead to your funeral? That'll!

It's an image most folks can recall:
In a wine vat, a two-woman brawl.
Or the candy disaster
(The belt moving faster).
The star of both scenes?  Lucille Ball.

We've been eager to party and drink,
But the tap on the keg's on the blink.
So it's soda, not beer—
Nothing's happening here.
Kinda sadder Budweiser, I think.

The magician was highly revered,
Though his act was decidedly weird.
First he counted to ten,
Cried "Babooshka!" and then,
All at once, all his clothes disappeared!

Look, I know that for you it's been tough,
And you're sorry for breaking my stuff.
I can see you regret it —
Chill out! Let's forget it!
Your breast-beating's been quite enough.

Though society's governed by laws,
Written law's insufficient, because
There are times legislation
Needs clarification.
Then case law makes up for its flaws.

A most beautiful sight, all agree,
One of which I'm a real devotee,
Is Dungeness named.
For ecology famed,
It's a headland 'twixt marshland and sea.

At the picnic, we gathered to tug
On a rope. But some oversized lug
Yanked us all off our feet
And our loss was complete
Since our pull didn't work. We was drug.

A computing device that I bought
Didn't work in the way that it ought.
The first time I went out
It mis-plotted my route—
Took me miles from the place that I sought.

"Really awesome!" The girl cannot stop.
"Life's surreal!" she spews in a slop
Made from language that swerves
In to grate on my nerves.
Such descriptions are over the top!

Of Madonna, the pop star, it's said,
"She's a cabalist."  Don't be misled;
Cabalism's much more
Than an item she wore —
A royt bendel, a string that is red.

When a blustery headwind blows past,
Then you might think your flight is a blast.
What an airspeed — just read it!
(It's folly to heed it:
You're not goin' anyplace fast.)

This light breeze, it will frequently shift
From one point to another, and lift
My fine hair (it's unpinned it):
A baffling wind, it
Confuses. You catching my drift?

As Macbeth worked his way to the top,
His old mates, and the king, got the chop.
But, when dead Banquo's ghost
Came to call on his host,
All the banqueting just had to stop.

The folks are one's parents. One pokes
At them, fun. They're the butt of one's jokes.
Also folks can be souls
(As in "people"). My goal's
Now achieved, so I'll say, "That's all, folks."

I'm a drag-cove: I sit on a wagon,
With my flagon and pipe that I drag on.
I'm engaged to drive (hither
And yonder and thither)
Conveyances one sends one's bag on.

On her cheek was an ugly red pimple
That she ceaselessly scratched, pure and simple,
So it scarred; in its place,
There's a hole in her face,
Which she hopes you'll mistake for a dimple.

In each ear, you've an organ of Corti—
That's whether you're four or you're forty.
Corti's pillars and cells
Help you hear bells, or yells,
Or the roar of your Porsche engine, Sporty!

Every staff member dreads an appraisal;
Dissecting their sorrier ways'll
Leave anyone glum,
So tread carefully, chum:
If your judgements don't please 'em, a raise'll.

"I found panties," the newlywed roars,
"In my dresser.  I'm guessing they're yours!
Take them out!" bellows he,
"Or my bureau will be
Turned into my wife's chest of drawers!"

You poor blockheads, you pay a big price.
You're so cubelike, you don't look so nice.
Six square faces don't please
Joined at ninety degrees —
Plastic surgery ought to suffice.

I implore you:  Please do not contrive
High tech methods to keep me alive.
Should a gork I become,
Pull the plug!  (Don't be glum;
I'll be heaven-bound soon; there, I'll thrive!)

"Ca' canny ma lad," sez ma daddy,
"An' dinnae go takin' a maddy,
But see your bird Mary?
'S a clarty wee hairy
'At mings like a hauf-smokit haddie."

Whether probing the heart of the atom,
Or seeking a hard-to-find datum,
What I want first of all
Is the thing I might call
My primary desideratum.

My Best Friend sired a beautiful daughter.
I got all fired up and I sought her.
I'm no pervert, of course;
She's a young female horse,
That fine filly's a winner — I bought her.

Spelled C-double-h-u-r-p-i
(To pronounce it, I won't even try),
Cheese of cow's milk or yak's—
Among interesting facts:
It's consumed just by those who are high.

You won't find any sort of meter here.
Rhyme? We don't need no stinkin' rhyme.
This little poem is still
Shaped like a limerick—
But it breaks all the rules! It's free verse.

The Bikini would warn of attack:
No concerns when at white or at black;
At black special, take care;
If at amber, beware;
If at red, run away!  Don't look back!

"Give up working from home," the boss pleaded,
"Bob, your bodily presence is needed.
Our best client's confused;
Guess his ego's been bruised.
I screwed up. Your green light's superseded."

More canvas! We must have more sail!
Grab this wind and I swear we can't fail.
See the genoa fill?
Always gives me a thrill.
If we hold thirty knots, we prevail.

When big business declares that you must
Believe what they say — give them trust —
Though their ads may be brash,
Keep your head (and your cash),
And remember the word antitrust.

Go and work up a CBC, quick!
Dengue fever has made her quite sick.
Count of red and white cells
And hematocrit tells
That her blood concentration's too thick.

You're as short as a small dish antenna, Sis.
There is no one as short in Vienna, Sis.
I tell people, "Don't tease
Or you'll risk both your knees.
She was born with achondro-damn-genesis!"

In their dining hall, known as the frater,
Anthropophagous monks all debate. A
Vote has been taken
On breakfast: eggs, bacon
And tea-lady (blessed 'er, then ate 'er).

The well in our yard has been free
Of water since 1903.
We've used it instead
To bury our dead.
It's as bone-dry a place as can be.

Time and Relative Dimension in Space:
Look, the TARDIS, on Earth, has touched base.
Doctor Who is inside.
Once the Time Lord is spied,
There'll be monstrous new dangers to face.

That Goldilocks vandal should pay!
She's behaved in a scandalous way,
Being rude to those poor bears.
That cub and his forebears
Showed too much forbearance, I'd say.

If your baby is driving you wild
And you fear you'll be shaking your child,
Put her cradle and her
Out of reach, we'd prefer,
Till you chill from ill-tempered to mild.

In spite of its blubber, who'd know
That a walrus, who lives in the snow,
Would sometimes behave
In this way? It will wave
A quick flipper to fan its warm glow.

She's familiar; I've seen her before:
Those features, that laugh… and much more.
Mustn't gawk; I'll alarm her;
Be direct, and disarm her.
"Pardon me. Have you worked as a whore?"

"Ooh, Baby!" I said to Michelle,
"Let me baby you here for a spell.
Lie down and guess what—
I'll rub oil on your butt!
Ooooh!  It's soft as a baby's as well!"

He's a narcissist. Ask him right now,
And he'll gladly (and how) take a bow.
He conducts his affairs
While he's putting on airs—
Cat's pajamas (like wow!), cat's meow!

Many carthorses once used to haul
Loaded carriages, huge down to small.
Though you're surely aware
That these beasts now are rare,
They've not vanished — most have, but not all.

An obsessive called Jake from Australia
Liked to deck himself out in regalia.
What produced the great splash
At our Halloween bash?
Not his outfit—his loud coprolalia.

There once was a fellow named Hopper
Who, for being quite rude, came a cropper.
Now he's sitting in jail
For he tickled the tail
Of a sly, undercover she-copper.

A contrarian octogenarian
Asked for porn from a chary librarian.
She refused and he fussed;
He insisted, "You must!
I've got rights! I'm a civil libertarian!"

"Not diamonds! I told you before, on
Your drill use some Borazon, moron!"
He told me with ardor,
"This stuff is much harder:
The crystalline nitride of boron!"

This budget committee's a trap;
Their pretense of fair-mindedness, crap!
They've already agreed
On no increase.  We'll need
To use last year's amount as a cap.

A beaver, a true-love believer,
Was attached to a golden retriever.
Though he knew that the dog
Couldn't chew on a log,
He just wooden't conceivably leave her.

Dental follicles: growing beneath
The gums of a baby—the sheath
That will grow, in a while,
To be part of her smile—
They're the sacs of developing teeth.

The Fifties had slang we should mention:
Some phrases of teenage invention.
To your buddy or pal
('Cept of course, if a gal) —
"Hey, daddy-o!" got his attention.

I emerged from post-operative coma;
They had dealt with a chondroblastoma.
Said the surgeon, "That's fine!
Though... I'd thought it benign.
Seems 'benign' was perhaps... a misnomer."

In the square in the center of town
Stood the tree in her snow-spangled gown.
High atop perched a star
To be seen from afar,
As a radiant beacon and crown.

My friend broached the topic of poach,
With a very faint hint of reproach.
I thought he was staring
At the brooch I was wearing—
'Twas the wine keg he wanted to broach!

An Arabian chef, Mahmoud Knepper,
A condiment pro, a high-stepper,
On the food that he bakes,
Will just give a few sheiks
Of incredibly fine sultan pepper.

A jovial greeter has heartiness.
A streetwalking hooker has tartiness.
An aesthete will show—
With a classic Corot
Or a vintage van Gogh—he has artiness.

There's a circumlocutious debater
Who revels in not talking straighter.
He speaks round and round,
So his words just confound.
To debate him you need a translator.

At Harrow, the bill is a list
To record all the students who missed
Or attended. This tally
Tells boys: "Those who dally
Will suffer a rap on the wrist!"

A keg full of powder is stirred.
For a conflict, we constantly gird
As Iran threatens violence.
Your deafening silence
Speaks volumes.  What's heard?  Not a word.

Behind files piling high, he would lurk;
If you caught his attention, he'd smirk.
He would shirk all his work
Then behave like a jerk—
Smitty Kirk, our esteemed city clerk.

Define cheese factor? "Dealer in cheeses."
There's a merchant who constantly pleases.
I predict when I say
"I don't want cheese today"
As the moment when, over, hell freezes.

Ah, dark Africa—orphaned, abused,
So abandoned, accursed and misused—
Leaves me feeling aghast,
And I ask: "Can this last?
How can something so mad be excused?"

With CD on your car (not a bike),
You're no person who's likely to strike.
Corps Diplomatique
Is the crowd or the clique
Of ambassadors and/or the like.

A silk fabric with rich, gold brocade,
A cloth top in a church's parade,
Or a structure of stone
Over altar or throne—
Call each baldachin, you won't have strayed.

By ascribing we mean that we say
That some X did some thing one past day.
We don't know if X did;
Someone else may have hid
His own deed behind X's this way.

If described as dysgenic, it means
You have negative traits in your genes;
Whilst the positive kind,
As eugenic defined,
Are improving of man's social scenes.

So here are the facts: if you're lax
In paying your tax to the max,
Then the exciseman will
Soon be sending a bill.
Unpaid tax keeps that man on folk's backs.

Never one to conceal erudicity,
I eschew any nods to simplicity.
Take those drinking straws there—
I'd describe them with flair:
"Yonder tubules possess cylindricity."

Slutty School Girls is not what you'd call
Edutainment.  This movie's a ball,
And it sure entertains.
But enriching your brains?
Educational?  No, not at all.

The Beltie is Galloway's news:
White band with black jacket and trews.
As a worm is to silk,
Some can even make milk—
An Oreo cookie that moos!

Insignificant? Think of your skin,
And the casings throughout your within.
So don't make it an issue:
Epithelial tissue
Is crucial for holding stuff in.

The substance called blende's not a drink.
It's part sulfur, which means it might stink.
It's the brownish-black ore
Of some metal—want more?
You can figure it out if you zinc.

A printer of intricate data
Found flaws in her latest errata.
But 'twas hard to detect
What had caused that effect,
When that causatrix caused her causata.

Every Blume isn't certain to be
Productive, attractive (like me),
Since we also have felons
With heads shaped like melons:
A branch of our family tree.

What a fine stretch of waterfront land!
It is strewn with bright pebbles and sand.
This beach is so...beachy,
So perfect, so peachy!
Let's stroll down the strand, hand in hand.

Where the Earth's brittle skin is consumed,
The subduction volcanoes have bloomed.
Back-arc basins have formed
Where crust stretched as it warmed.
In collision these basins are doomed.

Tiny tents, weeny tent-pegs: at dawn
An encampment appears on our lawn.
The intruders advance:
They're an army of ants.
Fetch the mower: we'll soon test their brawn.

Is the look that she's giving "come hither"?
Serenade her all night with my zither?
Should I stay? Should I go?
How's a man meant to know?
Will she go while I dally and dither?

That catgut might rightly belong
Where you're needing a string to be strong.
When you put your request in
For twisted intestine,
Your suturing never goes wrong.

You want me to strike off your fetter?
I can write your attorney a letter,
But for now, I'm afraid,
Though I'll offer you aid,
Of escape I can't be an abettor.

Like the strings of a teeny bikini
Are the strands of what's called capellini
(That's Italian. Compare
With the English: "thin hair"),
So it's not just some skinny linguine.

Do you feel you are really depressed?
Stay in bed? Don't get up or get dressed?
See your doc; ask to try
This new SSRI
Called citalopram. Give it a test.

Disembark, find my flight's carousel.
Watch the bags ride around. They look swell!
But where's my portmanteau?
Packed up in this canto,
It's "bagonise" (lost luggage hell).

A coistrel will revel and roister;
The world is this miscreant's oyster.
A knave and a varlet,
He'll hassle the harlot
And chase every nun in the cloister.

To reveal all the passion I feel,
For Neil's birthday I'm cooking a meal.
It will start with a wallop—
A creamed dish of scallop
That's cooked in a shell—a coquille.

Was the Bandersnatch frumious? Yes!
But just why would be anyone's guess.
The words furious and fuming
Were joined (we're presuming)
Carroll's readers worldwide to impress.

All my yearning's become a phantasma
Since my internist tested my plasma.
Now I no longer strive
For a sea-bottom dive,
As I suffer from bronchial asthma.

It's a job-for-life promise. You're hired!
Glad it matches to what you aspired.
Guaranteed? But of course!
And it's always in force
(Till our get-out clause trips. Then you're fired).

Antidandruff: its meaning is clear,
It's a product that helps us appear
Free of pesky white flakes
That annoy. Dandruff makes
Of our shoulders a snowy frontier.

As his oaths erupt hot and Vesuvial,
It's unlikely that jolly or groovy'll
Slip out as Josh sloshes
Without his galoshes
Through weather that's gotten diluvial.

Their delaying stunts are a concern.
Without movement, our plans crash and burn.
But the act won't be stalled
If the question is called…
Right now! Before long we adjourn.

If one gets hepatitis, type B,
Then Dane particles (too small to see)
Are the virions found
In the blood. They abound.
Seek vaccine; from this scourge remain free.

Any surgeon who works with precision,
But is troubled by chronic blurred vision,
Can no longer evade
Some dioptrical aid,
And he'll soon have to make a decision.

He had wordlessly pointed his gun,
And in silence the stick-up was done.
Then by accident he
Shot himself in the knee,
Acting dumbly in more ways than one.

Thanksgiving delights all aggrate,
With blessings and food on each plate.
So to each I will say,
Have a wonderful day.
I hope that your turkey's first-rate!

A big festival — celebrate, yay!
They are feasting down Mexico way,
Where the local priest blessed a
Muy grande fiesta.
Quick, teach me some Spanish! ¡Olé!

I am just not quite sure that I'm ready
To ask darling Jean to go steady.
With a number so great
Of swell gals I could date —
My liberty now leaves me heady!

The bowler appeals, "How was that?
The batsman's pad isn't his bat!"
The umpire's aloof:
He hasn't seen proof
That the ball would have knocked the stumps flat.

Each limerick comprises five lines,
Which the editing process refines.
I have herewith disclosed
Such a one I've composed;
You'll find both of these words it combines.

A bai is a yellowish dust
Moving east in a mist on a gust.
Out of China it blows
To Japan. I suppose
They're displeased there, but mostly adjust.

Vainly prodding a germ on a slide,
The cytologist said, "Come on, glide!
I suspect what it lacks is
Some strong chemotaxis
To move towards the food on that side."

From its circular base its wall zone
Slopes up to a point? That's a cone!
Spin a triangle's plane
'Round one side and again:
Each other side's path shapes...a cone!

There are biotite flakes in this schist.
Nature's added this black mica twist.
Though its name's not well known,
Schist's a commonplace stone
With panache. It will not be dismissed.

Corrupt crony capitalism tends
To flow dough to relations and friends
Of insiders who lead.
Their fat buddies succeed,
While those outside hit walls and dead-ends.

That guy Ted is a dipwad; he's jerky.
His thinking is muddled and murky.
From faulty conclusions
To screwball delusions,
I'm led to adjudge him a turkey.

It is hard to believe, goodness knows:
Picture beach hockey programs with pros
Shooting balls, not a puck.
Sponsors said, "What the hell
Are we doing? This stinks and it shows!"

As we bond, two electrons entwine.
In coordinate bonds, they're both mine.
My electron assailants
Eclipse normal valence.
Dipolar? We charge to combine.

As the bully grabbed hold of my hair,
He yelled, "Cave!" In the depths of despair,
I gave in. Still, I mused,
"Why's that word often used
By Stalky as whispered 'Beware!'?"

Comedian Bob couldn't cope
At the rock show; he whined, "What a dope.
Why's that strutting young fool
Got a hole-making tool?"
"'Cause the dude has a band and awl, Hope."

My bank account's nice to behold
When it's black with its balance of 'gold'.
But when I'm in the red,
And I owe cash instead,
Then I'm blue, and my spending's on hold.

To play flapdragon, one must be brazen,
Bravin' liquor that's actually blazin',
To pluck from that brandy,
And gobble like candy
A hot, floating plum or a raisin.

Commencement commences today,
But the speaker has bupkes to say:
He'd explain what life means,
But he doesn't know beans—
We're expecting some pea-brained cliché.

A calcareous substance like Tums,
With its calcium carbonate, comes
To the rescue on nights
When you're seeing the sights
With your chums chasing vodkas with rums.

Korea was Chinese no more,
Nor Formosa's small islands offshore:
Both were lost in the fight
(Much to Nippon's delight)
In the first  Chino-Japanese War.

When Gus worked on your car, he smoked pot,
And your engine now leaks, cold or hot.
It's this seal that's the curse,
Which is why it acts worse.
Seems your gasketed crankcase is not.

Fenster Hadfield professed his vile bride
Was a harlot he'd bedded in Hyde.
When she'd said they should marry,
He should have been wary,
But pitied the lass and complied.

Foreign policy: are we meanderin'?
To Putin and Xi we are panderin'.
Are they friends or our foes?
It appears no one knows.
Should we teach our kids Russian or Mandarin?

I am ever a gentleman, truly.
I'm not boorish, uncouth or unruly.
I would never say, "Honey,
Hand over your money,"
Or laugh at your problems unduly.

It's a dangerous bay in this light,
But those pirates present a worse plight.
It's inviting disaster
To fight their three-master,
As their barque is much worse than this bight.

This amylum (starch that's in fruits,
And in seeds, tubers, stem pith and roots)
Is a part of your food,
But has come to be viewed
As a crime by the Atkins recruits.

He concerted a viable plan:
"Though I can't cross that barbed-wire span,
I'll just play on the pier.
When he comes out to hear
My brief concert, I'll capture my man."

Four lines make an elegiac stanza.
One notices that when one scans a
Sweet sonnet that we
See rhymed abab,
Or in Gray's famous churchyard bonanza.

In the apocatastasis, Satan
At last will be able to straighten
Things out with the Lord,
And perhaps can afford
To live somewhere more pleasant, like Dayton.

It's not Wendy's in little kids' eyes,
Nor McDonald's, though that may surprise.
At times they want treats
Of flame-broiled eats
And repeats of BK Chicken Fries.

Daft Danny O'Phee of Tralee
Would hang by his knee from a tree.
The reason for that
Was to act like a bat—
He was batty as batty could be!

Faye's a bit off her rocker, I'd say,
And when stressed has a horrible day.
Please ease off of her case,
'Cause it isn't  your place
To say, "Faye, come what may,  go away."

-ful's a suffix, in adjectives seen,
Meaning "full of" or so, nice and clean.
We know mournful and hateful
And scornful and grateful —
A handful? No, many. Umpteen!

Hugh's appraised the huge house so admiringly,
And assessed their fine art most desiringly.
Now he calls fellow thieves
And insures he achieves
One more link in a life lived conspiringly.

"Not combustible" claims the brochure—
"Won't catch fire!"—big letters to lure
The Christmas tree buyer.
That flyer's a liar.
Fireproof flocking?  No way to be sure.

Father Boniface, I've no apology
For my 'actions untoward' in Christology:
I'm a heathen, it's true!
I know not what I do!
Was it so wrong to call it mythology?

There's a chef in the Army named Jeff,
A gourmet who is sightless and deaf.
Every doctor who took
A good look at this cook
(And his food!) said he can't be 4-F.

They're convicts, poor blokes, and it's plain
That their sentence is causin' 'em pain.
The reason they're screamin's
They're bound for Van Diemen's
Land, never to leave it again.

The bacterial bane known as fireblight,
For some fruit trees, is truly a dire blight.
It's the devil to cure
So, dear buyer, ensure
That your choice is less prone to acquire blight.

I informed freshman Congressman Clem
That bipartisanship for a Dem
Isn't giving a little
To meet in the middle;
Instead it's agreeing with them.

From living here near the frontier
And dealing with horses, I fear
That part of me panics,
For aeromechanics
Have taught me, "steer clear of the rear."

Junior's makeshift garage band employs
Lots of amps; it's a helluva noise.
They could rouse Aristophanes!
Oy, the cacophonies
Made by fifteen-year-old boys!

When the time comes to stay, then you go.
When the time comes to go, you say "Whoa!"
Boy, you sure got a penchant
For being dissentient.
Next time you want yes, you get no.

Mix some syrups with oils and you'll get
An eclegm. (Are you wondering yet?)
If you swallow a dose,
You may think it tastes gross,
As it's medicine. Who would have bet?

I said, "Barb, hon, that's not a real barb."
"It hurts. Tweeze it out," came her sob.
"It's a barbule, a hook.
They're quite small. Let me look."
"I'm harpooned! Now just please do your job."

Cleidocranial dysplasia can cause
Many defects that some would call flaws,
But a comic I know
Makes them part of his show
And is earning abundant applause.

A ball hawk he is, their new pitcher—
From thrower to catcher, a switcher!
Hit the ball toward the mound,
And you're surely just bound
To help that danged pitcher get richer.

Vain artists assert that abstractions
Elicit emotive reactions,
Yet the man on the street,
Viewing art as concrete,
Will see randomness, noise, and distractions.

Our appliance garage is complete.
Now it's lined, so the wood takes the heat.
With our toaster, our blender,
It's a kitchen defender!
Maybe pointless, but very discreet.

An air bag's designed to inflate,
Stopping windscreens from hitting your pate.
After all, why be dead?
(Also, Radiohead
Wrote a song of that name. They're so great.)

Though it should be for doves, columbarium
Holds no birds (nor yet fish — that's aquarium).
It's a place where, for cash,
You can stash all the ash
Of your loved ones, too chary to bury 'em.

So you're suffering aches in your gut?
Well, the cause may be hard to rebut.
Your large appetite's blamed.
With gastralgia you're shamed.
(Til it goes, maybe keep your mouth shut!)

This series, I'd call a sensation.
We're feeding the fans on frustration.
Continued extension
Of sexual tension
Fills viewers with anticipation.

It is truly a marvelous sight:
When the sarge calls, "Eyes left!" or "Eyes right!",
Eyes all turn to the brass;
In salute, soldiers pass.
Marching troops on the grass? Pure delight.

Queen Victoria's challenge was hurled,
And America's foresail unfurled.
Out of Cowes, Isle of Wight,
Beating Brits left and right,
Raced the schooner that conquered the world.

This is gin that's not getting us drunk.
It's a card game, you dull-witted lunk.
Three- or four-of-a-kind,
Or a run's good to find...
But the hand I was dealt is just junk.

Fuming gently atop my begonia,
A doodlebug sat all alonia.
"I don't pee — that's debased.
My nitrogenous waste
Is gassed out through my shell as ammonia."

A statement (let's label it 'p')
Must be true or untrue — you agree?
And 'not p', then, too
Must be true or untrue:
Excluded the middle must be.

Mix and fire, like bricks, but from dust
Nickel, manganese, cobalt, and rust.
Non-conductive, magnetic,
Ceramic, synthetic:
It's ferrite. In magnets we trust.

The letter was hand writ to me:
"You may call at  my home after three.
We'll eat crumpets and scones,
Speak in civilized tones,
And partake in a true English tea."

Shh, be still! Just pretend you're a file!
Look, it's coming — dumb, monstrous and vile!
Let it read, keep your nerve;
What it asks for, just serve!
Danger? Low, if you do it with style.

As the mining crew hammered and bored
Out their tunnels, and carefully shored
Up the walls with their staves,
They exposed ancient caves
In a mountain that nature has cored.

Tacked to words that we read, write or speak,
The combining form phile is unique,
The word philos (Greek) means
Loving thought intervenes.
So a Graecophile's fond of things Greek.

There are editors savage as bears,
So fierce that their workshopping scares;
My versified witticisms
Attract pungent criticisms—
But at least I can criticise theirs!

The cumulative effects of inhaling
All those glue fumes have left the kid ailing.
Sharp spasms, lost hearing—
His hair's disappearing—
In total, it isn't smooth sailing.

The deodar, one kind of cedar,
Is large; among trees it's a leader.
In high mountains it's met,
In Nepal and Tibet,
Far away, I regret, my dear reader!

My writing is bloodless and aimless;
Of course, I can't say that I'm blameless.
No editor should
Ever lie that it's good
Just to flatter me (that would be shameless).

An old British justice named Glover
Once murdered his wife and her lover.
A clue was then found:
His wig on the ground!
But you can't book a judge by his cover.

In Morocco, the food I like most
Is amlou, when eaten on toast.
This honey-nut spread
I will love 'til I'm dead.
This stuff is the boast of my host!

Grinding's hard, but he thought he could wrestle
With the job, using mortar and pestle.
He soon had a stroke,
As an artery broke—
A cerebrovascular vessel.

"You eat buffalo wings?  My-oh-my!
Heck, I never knew bison could fly."
"You don't know? What the dickens!
Those wings are from chickens!"
"But the menu says buffalo — why?"

On an architect's desk, one may see
A few technical sketches (croquis):
Maybe chic Arts and Crafts,
And although just rough drafts,
They're remotely backed-up on CD.

"The irregular shape of this spot
Means it's blotchily made, does it not?"
"Ooh-ooh-ooooh!" "Mr. Horshack?"
"That ink stain by Rorschach
Looks just like a birthmark I got."

"Barack eavesdropped, he wiretapped our phones."
So claimed Donald and all of his drones.
Will we see any proof
Or is this one more spoof
To deflect us to fantasy zones?

Without slaves, ancient Romans relate,
A colonus would work your estate.
He was "free" but a serf
Who was tied to the turf,
And paid rent — a solution first-rate.

I'll tell you with all due sincerity,
My fingers are lacking dexterity.
My skills alphabetic
Are truly pathetic.
At the keyboard, I type with temerity.

You need gravel? It's only crushed rock.
Swing a sledge hammer then, whack a block.
Smashing boulders to rubble
Is really no trouble,
Just blisters and backache and shock.

A frolleague's a colleague and friend,
But just where will this trend ever end?
Could then frooker become
A new word used by some
For a friend-who's-a-prostitute blend?

"Hey, let's do bouncy-bouncy," I said
To my wife, but my words were misread
By our children who heard.
Now the sex is deferred
As we visit a bounce house instead.

Little bean beetle, lovely and spotted,
Please depart from my plants. I've now plotted,
Since your ways are so shady,
Pretty bug of a lady,
Your demise, 'coz my soybeans have rotted.

The akbash was bred to guard sheep,
Like some super-strong canine BoPeep.
Fiercely loyal, today
Guarding kids is the way
They may sometimes be earning their keep.

The laundrymaid took the bed linen —
"Eatin' choc'late in bed?" she asked, grinnin'.
But then came the smell
And she let out a yell,
"It's a stable that they should've bin in!"

A monk at a Carmelite priory
Kept an itemized day-to-day diary.
He tracked, without rest,
All the things he possessed,
Then confessed to a life of acquiry.

An Inuit nomad I know
Was stricken with illness and woe.
He drew a deep breath,
Said, "To hasten my death
I think I'll just go with the floe."

Please be careful to not make it seem
That he's crazy. He just has a dream.
Moving boats with no sail—
Would he triumph or fail?
He's not mad, he's just blowing off steam.

"The bonk" is most likely to hit
When your sides are beginning to split
After cycling too far
With no energy bar
In your bonk bag at hand to be bit.

Appalachian, a cheese from raw milk,
With a texture described "smooth as silk,"
Has a buttery taste
(Hint of lemon?) embraced
By rich wine snobs and those of that ilk.

Here's the scam the sharp gambling-man hatches:
Join a game, roll the dice, but the catch is
They're false, so he'll win.
Looks like luck (his!) is in —
All thanks to his loaded dispatches.

Any surgeon will often be needing
A tool that can help stop the bleeding.
Cryocautery will
Many times fill the bill,
And ensure that the surgeon's succeeding.

First she speaks, then her husband agrees.
Ever nagging, it's obvious she's
Really got the poor bloke
In a marital yoke.
Oft he jokes, "Take my ball and chain, please!"

Down a blind lane, she said, "Do a u-ie.
It's a dead-ending byway!"  "Oh, phooey!
That map we bought lied;
Our new GPS fried,
And our compass? Gone south — acting screwy."

Yes, it's true, I miscue. I confess.
For a few that's a cause for distress,
But for every mistake,
A correction I make;
I'm a striver for accurateness.

Loads of room in the rear to lade freight,
And I'm licensed to serve every state.
I can clear a quick buck
On the bed of my truck,
But your cargo, sir, that's tempting fate.

Educationally speaking, I was...
Quite useless, and that was because
I was simply a fool
Who didn't like school
As much as The Wizard of Oz.

The nuts from mature cohune palms
Provide oil for a product that calms.
It's included in soaps
Which the soap-maker hopes
Are essential as one of life's balms.

The caddow or jackdaw's nefarious,
A crowlike bird, often gregarious.
Two flew to the altar
With scarcely a falter
And cawed at the priest, "Won't you marry us?"

With the aperture-synthesis trick,
Saving millions of dollars is slick.
By astronomers' art,
Smaller scopes, far apart,
Form a huge one that's sharp, if not quick.

"After treatment, I felt nicely woozy,"
Said a breast cancer patient named Susie.
Though it sounds like a joke,
Her left breast got a soak
From this thing called a "booby Jacuzzi."

When singing a tune diaphonic,
Their voices can be quite hedonic.
I can highly commend
How the two of them blend
In melody sweetly harmonic.

While I dated Melissa McCreedy,
Of more girlfriends I felt I was needy.
Dad advised: "Understand
That a bird in the hand
Is worth two in the bush. Don't be greedy!"

The barber who cut all my hair
Shaved my cranium close for a dare.
Now you giggle and hoot,
As I'm bald as a coot:
My fair hair's past repair—please don't stare.

The dibber stick pokes in the dirt
In a soil-mix, or mixtures inert.
Dib the seedling roots down,
Just as deep as the crown.
Now, some wetting with No-Damp won't hurt.

He farted, which started the air
To rush over here, over there.
An aeriferous vent
Took the scent as it went,
And it fouled where it went without care.

Self-denial! We've fasted three days!
Now we'll bellycheer: meats and beignets,
Cakes and ale for three weeks;
Must restock our physiques,
Singing lusty and genuine praise.

I can't for the life of me see
Abiologists spending on me
Analytical time,
And the reason is I'm
Not inanimate. Hi-yo! Whoopee!

There was a young baker named Jake
Who made the most fabulous cake
Like a fiery cat
With a lamb—fancy that!
'Twas inspired by William Blake.

Earth is farthest away from the sun
At a point in its orbital run
That is known as aphelion;
Its mate, perihelion,
Is simply the opposite one.

At home, he brews beer in his carboy
Then serves it; he's such a good bar boy.
It may seem bizarre
But he's Russian — a Tsar —
And he strums a guitar! He's a star boy!

The craft service puts out the snacks,
Bottled water and cold cuts in stacks.
So performers and crew
Have their cake, eat it too,
While the dolly grips lay some more tracks.

"You will marry? Then hear our decree:
An OEDILFer your bride has to be!"
I believe in monogamy,
But this is endogamy!
Elopement I clearly foresee.

A slender young lady from Prague,
Who writes a Czech beer-drinking blog,
Said, "I like to drink beer
Every day of the year,
And burn it off walking the dog."

Britpop was evolved to react
To American music—a fact.
That damn Yank stuff was grunge,
Which they tried to expunge
Because of the talent it lacked.

If ever the impulse should seize ya
Some day to employ anesthesia
As a mode of abduction
Or half-assed seduction,
I'll rip both yer arms off, ya sleaze, ya!

It's my paving-stone circle of bliss,
Filled with blazing hot logs — hear 'em hiss?
With Celeste by my side,
I had firepit pride . . .
Which then burned when she gave me a kiss.

Mr Bond is quite fond of a gadget,
But it's secret; he won't want to badge it.
He'd love to say, "Q,
Give me everything new—
If you don't, then I'll just have to cadge it."

You may think you are sound as a bell,
Full of get-up-and-go juice as well.
You will find all the same,
If you play a hard game,
You will still need the odd breathing spell.

When a creature is born, goes the distance
With which it then enters existence,
Starts its extance, emergence,
With zest, zeal and urgence,
Please offer it all your assistance.

Patricia, throughout adolescence
Was the image of meek acquiescence.
She's since conquered the fears
That had plagued her for years.
She's now having the grandest florescence.

An irrational number's a surd.
So are consonants found in a word
Such as ticket or shy
(But not bigger or guy).
So why is much nonsense absurd?

Many chocolateros abound
In the Gulf blowing cold air around
From the north every year.
Let's make one thing quite clear:
They are not stores where chocolates are found.

Anthropogeography shows
That when a society grows
It is shaped by ecology,
Terrain, and geology.
Now we bulldoze or reroute the flows.

My girlfriend insists I'm a kidder,
But for high naval rank I'm a bidder.
Because I'm a whiz,
A captainship is
The only ship I would consider.

The "less than" and "greater than" team
Has a plan, an objective, a dream:
They would like a slick name,
Like the caret of fame;
"He's the 'hat', we're the 'gloves'!" — that's the scheme!

From Deutschland, we've borrowed a word:
Gesundheit:  It's typically heard
When somebody sneezes.
(It's to ward off diseases
That otherwise might be incurred.)

Dinner parties are rather old hat:
Sit around a long table and chat,
Dress up posh, drink fine wine,
Knife and fork used to dine?
Now a barbecue's more where it's at!

Augusta's a capital place
Where the humblest of Mainers embrace
The potato and lobster,
And even the snobs stir
'Em up in a fine bouillabaisse.

The pain isn't easy to bear,
And I'd like to cry out but don't dare.
These damned hemorrhoids—ouch!
What I need is a couch,
And they give me a cushionless chair.

Precision's the ultimate mission
In chip-making, so the technician
Does not use a scraper
But chemical vapor
And finely attuned deposition.

I'd a hammer, but nothing to bang,
Till I found an old picture to hang,
But I did something dumb—
Went and hammered my thumb.
Up I sprang, and yelled, "Dang!" (Yup, that's slang.)

You're a prude and you say you can't stand
That my sexploits are notably grand,
Hotly sniffing, "This demon
Disseminates semen—
Spreads seedlets throughout the whole land!"

Editorialization: one's views
Are presented, not solely straight news.
A reporter's dominion?
Serve facts, not opinion,
And maintain the detachment some lose.

An alleyway loomed in my path.
Did it shelter a person of wrath?
Its walls seemed foreboding.
I felt them eroding.
I went home and took a hot bath.

The truth in a good allegory
Is symbolically wrapped in the story.
It may sound like the scene
After 'gator cuisine —
A falsehood derived a priori.

"Can I see you again?" I asked Beth
At date's end.  She said, "Don't hold your breath.
Truth be told, you're a loser,
An absolute snoozer,
A deadass who bores me to death."

Attenuate anything long,
It grows slender. The word is used wrong
If, when you ask me when you ate,
I answer, "Attenuate."
Such jokes in the trashcan belong.

It isn't your fault, I assure you,
Her beauty has managed to lure you.
I assign all the blame
To that dissolute dame. . . .
Still, I find that I cannot endure you.

Black Beauty's a novel, Lord knows;
A fine fossil T. rex; song of Flo's;
The Green Hornet's car;
A great Gibson guitar;
And an eggplant, a grape and a rose.

As primitive peoples all know,
Nothing grows from the seeds that you sow,
'Til you mix in the blood
Of your god with the mud:
Springtime deicide makes it all grow.

Fire fountains may sound pretty cool,
But don't stick hands or feet in that pool!
Lava plumes skyward shoot,
SO2 fills your snoot:
You'd be brave to get close...or a fool.

My free-thinking movie's not screenable;
The sound track is way beyond cleanable.
My friends will not gather
To hear filthy blather;
Premiere night will not be convenable.

Helpmates listing one's flaws, that ain't "lacklisting".
Mobsters making a kill list ain't "whacklisting".
But making a list
At Ole Miss, I insist,
Of those waiting admission, that's backlisting.

This particular tree, so I'm told,
Every autumn, has leaves of pure gold.
It is called the brown ash.
I can always use cash,
So I'll buy one wherever they're sold.

Chain reactors some think of today
As a cost savings energy play—
But a deadly emission
From uncontrolled fission
Is a paramount factor to weigh.

The Asian palm civet's a critter
Whose digestion makes java less bitter.
Fecal beans that it downed
Run six C-notes the pound?
Here, toddy cat! Come, use your litter!

There once was a man with an art
That from family would keep him apart.
He could pass lots of gas.
Yes, this sounds rather crass,
But His Flatulency mastered the fart.

When you "bank" with the mob, don't debate,
Or they'll hand you your ass on a plate.
The least of their crimes:
Charging interest ten times
The applicable federal rate.

"Butterfingers! Klutz!" Hear Mom scold.
"Grampa's beer stein was 90 years old!"
It slipped right through my hands.
A severe right cross lands
On my jaw and that's it. I'm out cold.

That Baer was a bear of a man—
He could knock you right flat on your can.
Though it's silly, his son
Played a hillbilly, one
With a Maximum get-girls-quick plan.

While whistling a whimsical shanty,
She cheerfully put in her ante.
"No sir, I'm no joker...
We're playing strip poker,
So why can't I ante my panty?"

A live baby is born — undeniable.
Called fetus or not, it's still viable.
A snip to the spine
Marks the end of the line.
Such acts make abortionists fryable.

This accomplishment's really a feat;
Our scientists think this is neat.
The best advance yet:
Corn with cow genes will get
Us a cereal-milk combo treat!

When the buffalo roam by your home
And this grass is what grows in your loam,
Don't discourage the herd:
It's the forage preferred
By all bison—a nice 'un, is brome.

A sauce for your salad's a dressing —
Vinaigrette, cooked or creamy — caressing
The greens, veg  or noodles.
It'll often add oodles
Of calories, diet-distressing.

Reactions to stimuli—viewed
Psychologically—seem to include
People's adience (buying)
Or abience (shying),
Dependent on impulse or mood.

Though it's not my ambition to loll 'em
To sleep with my bi-weekly column,
My editor thought
Stock analysis ought
To be colorless, boring, and solemn.

Said my hog-raising cousin named Sidney,
"Does the membrane that covers the kidney
Of my pig make you sick?
It's the barrow flick!" Ick!
Did he say that? Well, did he or didn' he?

In this coupe rode my very first date;
44 in a year, it's a crate.
Bye-bye, Delta! It's time
For the junkyard, so I'm
86ing my Olds 88.

We're on tour with our baby son Ted
And a camp cot instead of a bed.
This morning, this camp cot
Was rather a damp cot,
And Ted's little butt was all red.

To see a true gourmet grow faint,
We prepare something costly, yet quaint—
A dish so exquisite
That's well worth his visit—
But call it, most modestly, daint.

There's warmness or warmth when you're hot;
There's coolness or coolth when you're not.
We should all take delight
When the temperature's right —
And treasure the good things we've got!

It can mean a sports buff — an old crock,
Or elastic to shield you from shock,
But  "High Five" or low blow,
It's important you know
An athletic supporter's a jock.

As evidenced by the demand,
Users love buying pot that is canned.
Indisputable proof?
Sales have gone through the roof —
Far exceeding the volume we'd planned.

If a peaceful, but loud, demonstration
Stirs the wrath of an organization,
You'll win public support
If they choose to resort
To assault as they vent irritation.

When we feared that Katrina might kill
Ole Fats Domino (hardly a thrill),
How we wept and we moaned!
How we welled up and groaned!
How we cried upon Blubbery Hill!

All my faith in humanity's gutted.
Since my lot and my neighbor's abutted,
 Where they touched I had trod,
 And he sued me. My god,
We're abutting; must he be a butthead?

Fresh from Footloose, the star Kevin Bacon
Threw me out of my chair. I was shaken!
With no effort to greet me,
He'd moved to disseat me.
"Dis seat," he informed me, "is taken!"

New Year's Eve, and the future looks bleak
As my washing machine's sprung a leak.
"What's the damage?" I ask
Of the plumber. "Big task! —
Fifty quid — and your kidney, next week!"

I've no butt I can bandy about
Since I've taken the dieting route.
After months I can see
(At a hundred-and-three)
That my weight may be bottoming out.

Often shared at the end of the day,
Sweet endearments are words lovers say
To dispel any fear,
And to make very clear
Each is happy to stay, and not stray.

In Jurassic days, huge allosaurs
Had no hygiene; they lived out-of-doors.
But if they'd worn diapers
And used windshield wipers,
Their eyes would be clean. Not their drawers.

No fratricide, no, my dear mother,
I did not have a reason to smother
My sibling, your joy,
Mama's favorite boy.
No, I'd not cause the death of my brother.

Your leisurely ambulance drive'll
Be bad for your chance of survival.
ER doctors'll say,
"We're too late—DOA."
What a shame you'll be dead on arrival.

Listen Williamson, Moulton and Yang:
Most Dem voters do not give a dang
About you as a candidate.
You've nary a fan to date.
Drop out now, join the not-a-chance gang.

Barming, England, is out in the sticks,
West of Maidstone on A26.
Every farmer competes
For each woman he meets,
But the 'oppers know much better tricks.

Damn straight that my anger's intense.
Your ram rammed a hole in my fence.
See my garden? Your herds
Left no flowers, just turds.
Your flocks ate my phlox. Herd them hence!

"Your daughter is bold, so I'm told,"
Said a neighbor, some eight decades old.
"Yes, she's fearless and daring,
And you're overbearing,"
Said Mom to that nosy, old scold.

Passing cravings for girls, that's what ails you:
A febricula, brief but it nails you.
This spreads madly each spring,
Like a crush with a sting.
Momentarily, prudence flat fails you.

I'm greatly attached to the hyph-
en; you'll probably think that I'm trif-
ling, but splitting the syll-
ables, if it's done skill-
fully, gives the verse rhythm and life.

It's trivial and trifling, this thing,
Not some matter to bring to the king.
It's awkward and fiddly,
And probably diddly:
It's a footery word that I bring.

The Central's the longest of all;
It connects much of London's great sprawl.
Many stations are packed,
And you risk getting whacked;
Getting onto the train's like a brawl!

"By God, Sir! I've just lost my leg."
"By God, Sir, you have, but I beg
That a stiff upper lip
And some brave British quip
Will encourage the troops, what? Good egg!"

Little Mary extracted, near Lyme,
A curious shell from the slime.
Ammonitic, her find,
Of the fossilised kind,
Was preserved since the cradle of time.

My camera's my very best friend,
But at times I am forced to contend
With her artifacts. These
Form a photo disease
With some jags, noise, moiré, or a blend.

Hester Prynne's scarlet "A" would proclaim
Her dishonor (though love was to blame).
How such Puritan thought
Leads to true social rot —
That, we learn, is the damnable shame.

In Italy lived a Fascista,
A fascist, like Spain's Falangista.
In another arena—
Peron's Argentina—
Such a man would be called Peronista.

It's a unit to measure your gem,
Or the width of a tulip's green stem,
Or the length of a bee,
Not too big, not too wee,
'Bout four tenths of an inch: one cm.

This submarine landscape extends
Out from continents. Then it descends
To the deep ocean floor.
There is much to explore
In its shallows, for many good ends.

In my play there was so much to say,
To perform it took near half a day,
So I halved it.  Then four
Jerks blue-penciled much more;
Those four shortened my foreshortened play.

In the Scouts, we did scarves up with woggles;
A switch of alternatives toggles,
And when I dive, searchin'
For shrimp or sea urchin,
I see undersea with my goggles.

While chatting with someone or other,
Cleopatra, Caesarion's mother,
Said, "Boy, the kid's solemn. He's
Last of the Ptolemies,
Caesar's son." (He was killed by his brother.)

Calorimeters measure the heat
Given off by the egg that you eat.
Do you think it's one joule?
Then you're either a fool,
Or your snack's a room temperature treat.

The National Anthem was played
By a band whose adapter had made
It uniquely conform
To a dissonant swarm
Of kazoo-toting clowns on parade.

When in light or EM radiation
The E-field describes a rotation
That's clockwise (or not),
Then the light that you've got
Shows elliptical polarization.

If your cattle crave clover to dine,
It's a cowherd you seek for your kine.
But if they need pasture,
Or maybe weed, faster,
Then drovers in Rovers are fine.

"Though it's stamps you collect, I'm confused
Since the ones that you seek all are used."
"No, I buy CTOs:
Nothing new, only those
That from actual work were excused."

My calendar hangs on the wall,
Spring and summer and winter and fall.
As I stare at each square
And I see nothing there,
I declare I have no life at all.

Of a cuckold the miller now speaks,
Of a fool, his young wife, and her cheeks,
And the games that she plays
With one Nick, whose quick ways
Bring yet stickier ends than he seeks.

ABEND is an acronym showing
That programming logic's not flowing
Quite the way that it should,
But it probably would
If the programmer's brain were more knowing.

All her life my dear wife had a hope
She might bathe with autumnal (fall) soap.
Winter, summer and spring
I'd find soap I could bring;
But not fall soap — nope, false hope.  She'd mope.

Winked John, as he straightened his spine,
"My technique, I shall try to define:
Campanology's high—
Pulling ropes to the thigh—
Is improved when the thigh isn't mine."

Though the mezzo sang Carmen quite lustily,
Don José sang his arias rustily.
He'd a cold in his head
And his larynx was red.
His bad news? My review's written crustily.

The monopolist needed a sedative;
The trust-busters' cries were repetitive.
"Your market share rose
When you bought all your foes;
In a word, you are anticompetitive!"

Asynchronous transfer mode sends
Little parts of some data one tends
To receive disarranged,
But the stream seems unchanged:
It's sent quickly, and seamlessly blends.

Charlie Brown's not a blockhead! They call
Him that name, though his head's like a ball.
Their mean taunts are not fair—
It's not boxlike or square
(And he's really quite smart, all in all).

My pal Porgie plays blues on the harp.
From my perch I'm reluctant to carp,
But in treble and bass,
This sprat loses his place,
And plays flat when he ought to play sharp.

Though she's sweet and as meek as a rabbit,
My girlfriend attends witches' sabbat,
So I'm worried, and scared too,
And fully prepared to
Disaccustom her—break that bad habit.

"You're a child of the universe and
All the trees and the stars think you're grand."
Ancient new-age baloney
Turned out to be phony:
'Twas penned by a modern-day hand.

I look forward to each break of day,
Since I'm young and can do as I may.
Thus, at each day's beginning,
I find myself grinning
At others' old age and decay.

"The invaders cannot carry on
With our signposts deranged or just gone."
"Wait — the signs moved or tossed?
This explains why I'm lost.
Is that Ipswich ahead or San Juan?"

Finding drill-bits too slender, King Ed
Snatched the diadem down from his head
And, rotating with vigour,
Could bore a hole bigger.
"I dub this the crown-saw," he said.

Bitchin' longboard's twelve feet nose to tail,
And her deck's freshly waxed rail to rail.
Now it's time to take off
For your breaker's smooth trough.
Suck some wind, bro; ashore you'll exhale.

Don't dispute with a cunning orator.
If you do, you know sooner or later,
As the argument grows,
You may well come to blows
And have need of a fair arbitrator.

Aluminum sulfate's acclaim?
It's a compound, retardant to flame.
Says my chemistry chum,
Who's a Cal Tech alum,
"Call it alum—they're one and the same."

During conflict, a chaplain takes more
Of the flak, when the boys feel unsure.
While he hasn't denied
Right has God on its side—
But which side, now the troops are at war?

The ol' bronchogram, quite an affair:
They would numb up your throat, and from there
Down your lungs would apply
Radiography dye.
But don't worry: these days, it's just air.

I just hated that seat, 30E,
For what sat in the seat next to me
Was a huge butt a-jutting.
We sat, butts abutting,
Non-stop from Spokane to DC.

To Adrianopolis, go
And see Hadrian's city — although
It's been Turkish for years,
So on maps it appears
As Edirne (much more apropos).

A coal-mining Kiwi named Dickie
Found ambrite, a paste, very sticky.
As Dickie did clamber
For fossilized amber,
Its resin stuck fast to his picky.

To the boss: I am sad to report,
Though the guy is a pretty good sort,
Seems our newest of models
Is duck-legged; he waddles.
His legs are uncommonly short.

A basketball player who's quick
Sees his teammate is setting a pick.
So he squares up and shoots
(His three-pointers are beauts),
But surprisingly throws up a brick.

The party's at your place or mine —
I don't care much, if you bring the wine.
We'll drink up and fall down;
We'll drive madly through town —
Your booze and my death wish combine.

With the currency being debased
And its purchasing power erased,
Double-digit inflation
Will soon grip the nation.
Our leaders should all be disgraced.

Cornucopia, noted the fool,
Should be plural, according to rule.
It's the horn of a goat,
So the answer he wrote—
"Cornucopium's plural"—ain't kewl.

Healthy food groups include meat and fruit.
But my children? They don't give a hoot.
They love sodas and shakes
And candy and cakes.
(But they're healthy and growing to boot!)

I've known plumbers of highest repute,
And known others who don't give a hoot
If your sewer's all packed-up—
That sort I'd have backed up
To their own Roto-Rooters, and root.

These pots have used barbotine clay
On their surface, for ornament. They
Are called barbotine pots.
This fine clay is used lots
On these pots, and so what's more to say?

Caveman Dana called Bill (who's his butler). He
Asked: "Is there nothing that's subtler? We
Stuff our big maws
With our huge hairy paws;
It is time I invented some cutlery."

Cimicifuga: insect repellers.
They ease pain, so say herbal cure sellers.
For most bugs they're a bane;
But we seldom complain,
Though these herbs can be somewhat strong smellers.

"Flaming Nora! This water's like ice!"
Cried the girl, "Flipping heck, it's not nice!
Though I really adore a
Good swim ... flaming Nora!
Keep out is my blinking advice!"

She stood there and rattled her tin
For a charity badge on a pin;
And if you sneaked by,
While avoiding her eye,
You were left feeling guilty as sin.

"My dear woman," the bishop announced,
"I will not let your vicar be trounced!
All the evidence seems
(I refer to his screams)
To establish that you, Madam, pounced."

Into grammar I've just dipped my toe.
I've discovered the diptote.  Yeah, so?
It's a noun that's quite lonely.
It has two cases only.
Want to further inflect it?  No go!

Eddie Haskell was bursting with pride.
June learned of his nuptials and cried.
He snatched up a Cleaver,
But left it to Beaver
To tell Ward that Wally's the bride.

Had my buildings been built on a stilt
Far above the alluvial silt
On those plots that I've gotten,
They'd stop going rotten,
Like most other buildings I've built.

Now butterfly orchid's a name
That a great many species can claim.
Greatly varied in hue,
Brightly colored, it's true
All are lovely, though none look the same.

He was first in the Derby—so fast!
In the Preakness he'd not be surpassed;
But he broke from the gate,
Snapped a leg, and 'twas fate
That this race became Barbaro's last.

We had marshalled a small expedition
For the field marshal's forward position.
But they proved overmatched
When detachments dispatched
Stayed indifferent—detached from their mission.

Sweeney's livestock thought Sweeney was swell.
He'd go by, though, and kale felt unwell.
This confirmed vegetarian
Was to greens brutalitarian,
But greens are self-centered as hell.

Mom reviews all my homework each night
And she checks every reference I cite.
This everyday edit
Deserves lots of credit—
She copyreads all that I write.

I could talk to just one, for a start,
But this company's not à la carte.
When I venture "Hello",
They all stare at me: Go!
It's their cliquishness sets them apart.

The Commission on Human Rights, cleavin'
To what the UN was achievin',
Thought rights were such beauties
They'd scorn all the duties
That right-thinking people believe in.

Aurea mediocritas ain't
Just a phrase that is foreign or quaint.
It's the famed "golden mean",
Or the state  that's between
Rude abandon and prissy restraint.

As "Falling in Love Again" dies
From a screen where The Blue Angel flies,
The old and the fond
Dream of Lili, a blonde
Now cheering the troops in the skies.

Comes to eating, I'll pounce on each crumb!
Second helpings are simply — yum, yum!
As I grow ever plumper
They're calling me "Bumper";
A self-fatner is what I've become.

As the cardinals pick a new pope,
They will take my advice—so I hope:
Choose a good Catholic guy
Who on prayer can get high,
So he won't need to tope or do dope.

I'm engaged in genetic research
Into why there are people who lurch
When they're taking a walk,
Or who spit when they talk,
Or who curse even when they're in church.

Trump disparages folks with the same
Long-time, cherished canicular name.
We can see from our logs
How his foes are like dogs;
If we call him the same, he's to blame.

Egregious, an interesting word,
Once meant "great," "standing out from the herd."
Now it's "flagrant," "deplorable,"
"Shocking," and "horrible."
An utter one-eighty occurred.

Our relationship's pretty much shot,
So I'm leaving, believe it or not.
Don't you think that I'm going?
Your bank account's showing
I took all the money you got.

I admit I'm a bit of a critic
Of OEDILF, and I'm sometimes acidic,
But I find it absurd
To define every word:
If of albite it's made, it's albitic.

In the desert, an ear-tip appears
(With its mate) as I drink. Half my beer's
In my gut when a nose
Comes in sight. Thus it goes,
For a fennec's a fox that's all ears.

See that C in a circle? Sí, sí!
What you're reading's protected, at sea
Or on land, in the air,
Anywhere. So beware:
It's my copyright, don't mess with me!

Don't be cryptic; just say what you mean.
Keep your words and your sentences lean.
For a dose to allay
Venom's damage, just say
Antivenin, not antivenene.

That "No-Balls-At-All Ball" was eventless.
With no action, it couldn't have meant less.
There are no men at all
Who attend such a ball;
I resent these events that are gent-less.

"Here's my plan," said our prez, "job creation.
I'm sure it will cause stimulation.
It's antirecession."
I get the impression
It's not, given lasting stagnation.

I have cause to regret the sad day
That the Court gave the White House away
To a gang of sharp thieves.
For this cause my heart grieves:
That my country's in great disarray.

Captivator: my kitten's main role.
He will pounce on my feet as I stroll.
Then he'll offer his tummy
And purr for his mummy.
His charm's won my heart and my soul.

You've drawn down our troops overseas,
Mr. President.  Now, if you please,
You should draw down our debt,
'Cause if not, then I'll bet
That we'll all soon be speaking Chinese.

Gram and Gramps had my dad through their screwing.
Dad had me on his own just by doing
God only knows what.
We're not stuck in a rut:
Now it's my turn, and gals I'm pursuing.

Bioethicists: eggheads involved
In dilemmas that people want solved.
Is it okay to clone
If the cells are one's own?
(But such questions are seldom resolved.)

The first snowfall this year's no great shakes—
Just a flurry is all, a few flakes.
Though it's gently delightful,
It can blossom to frightful.
I think this year I'm pulling up stakes.

Disappointment upon him descended
When his mother said, "Isn't this splendid?
Here's your first big-boy suit!
Don't you think that it's cute?"
There his birthday essentially ended.

The campaigning's all done (what a fizzle).
Now democracy sausages sizzle.
The real snag with this biz
Of election day is
Four more years now of nothing but grizzle.

I'm not askin' for much, just a fraction
Of every illegal transaction.
Take a salary? Not me!
I'll be workin' for free.
All I want is a piece of the action.

Agelaius are blackbirds (gregarious).
Shoulder epaulets sort species (various).
"KonkaREE" the males sing
As to cattails they cling:
Defending each harem (vicarious).

Sleet and snow caught us all on the hop,
Then it rained for an hour without stop.
Wind and hail followed on
Till the sun calmly shone:
Yes, the weather's all over the shop.

The town that was once called Grand Chute
Has a name now that honors our fruit.
That was more than enough,
'Til a history buff
Said it's actually named for a suit.

In sounding the depths of the sea,
One charts bathymetrically,
Using meters or fathoms
To measure the chasms
Where tentacled monsters there be.

You're a boxer, a physical lad,
But the Wheel's winning phrase has you mad.
So you ask for an "O"—
It's for "awesome," you know—
But your spelling's not awesome, it's bad!

Dear Daisy: Once stray, you were sad;
Pleading eyes stole our hearts, we were had!
Been six years to the day,
And we just want to say —
What a bitch!  Lots of love, Mom and Dad.

Ballerinas will go all the way.
It's the classical music, some say.
Greta calls, "Come and get me!"
I know that she'll let me.
That gal puts the let in ballet.

"This organ," says Bach, as he kicks it,
"It's broken? That's your ipse dixit.
Should you mend it? First I'll
Check its musical style:
If it isn't baroque, we won't fix it."

An aceticoceptor's a chain
Of molecules on a campaign
To link with an acid,
Acetic and placid;
A radical thing to obtain!

You're a criticiser?! You've got a cheek
To be claiming my rhyming is weak
And my meaning obscure.
I should think, no, I'm sure,
You can't write, so you choose to critique.

Essex girl and a modern computer:
Each responds different ways to a tutor.
For that slow-learning dunce
You must punch more than once.
I should know; I've for years been her suitor!

My birch tree is missing, and, dammit!
Some beaver has managed to cram it
Into Stillwater Creek.
See, he's stemming a leak
With more branches to span and enjamb it.

Tim decided to go to the gym
For some weightlifting, maybe a swim,
But he found such a crowd
That he shouted out loud,
"Hey, it's chock-full: it's filled to the brim."

That librarian needs information:
How to float for a lengthy duration.
But that's hard to obtain
As she circles the drain.
It's been shelved, out of (gulp!) circulation.

She said, "The consistency's sloppy.
It's glutinous, gloopy, and gloppy,
And messy, and sticky,
And all-around icky.
I won't swallow your oatmeal.  You copy?"

Will there be something else that you need?
Is that everything? Oh, you exceed
What you brought in your wallet?
"Cash and carry", we call it—
Lack of dough? "Put it back" is our creed.

Its benignancy helped put to rest
All my fears 'bout the lump in my breast.
A biopsy proved
That it should be removed,
But malignant? No, only a pest.

I'm the world's greatest writer, no less —
On a par with Will Shakespeare, I guess.
Gee, I'm pleased you agree,
But I meant you to see
Braggadocio's always BS.

8 plus 7, two 5's, 12 and 9;
That's so easy, my figuring's fine:
15, 10, 21 —
Isn't figuring fun!
Now I'm figuring your life with mine.

Once, my fan mail poured in by the sack—
Posted plaudits, a paper attack.
Guess my star's lost its glitter;
Groupies tweet me on Twitter.
Call me bitter, but Twitter's just wack!

How my wall glows a dull eerie green!
Aroused phosphors light up a big screen.
I'm entranced by the presence
Of electroluminescence,
Low-energy light, cold and clean.

From your very first day here on Earth,
Let's be honest: there's disparate worth.
Some are born to great wealth,
Some to delicate health.
It's a crapshoot, this thing we call birth.

The astrophotographer said,
"All those star pics I take overhead
Are no good for my back —
Sacroiliacs crack!
So tonight, on my roof goes my bed."

When you've sucked all the juice from the cane,
The dry bits of pulp that remain
Are known as bagasse,
Which reminds me, alas,
What relaxed-fitting jeans might contain.

An endeavor I think would be clever?
Writing limericks forever and ever.
I'll work hard day and night.
Should you ask if I might
Take a pause when I write, I'll say "Never!"

The bass on this piece must sound strong,
And not waver in pitch and go wrong,
For he's singing a drone—
That's just one note, alone,
From beginning to end of the song.

Where's the meaning? Look, here's my position:
We're a dictionary, hence, definition.
If meaning ain't vital,
To heck with our title.
(Here he showed some aggressive dentition.)

In Chinatown, gang members chat
And decide a new crime's where it's at—
Nabbing pets is a breeze!
Better watch your Burmese
Or you'll hear, "Has the Tong got your cat?"

The Creole State stands all alone.
Its assets are globally known:
Great places to dine,
The jazz halls so fine,
And zydeco music, homegrown.

The dry spell, prolonged and extreme,
Imperilled the shaman's esteem,
So he danced in a trance
On the chance he'd enhance
The small base flow sustaining his stream.

That date stamp is old, I can see,
Since the date stamped reads nineteen-oh-three.
So this book, though brand new,
Seems to be overdue!
How I hope you won't charge me a fee!

I spied my shrink's notes and the label
Of basket case—patient unable
To cope...suffers panic
Attacks and is manic
Depressive...with meds, is more stable.

In the fall we find fading gets faster
For all but the flowers of aster.
In bold color they're draped
As they grow daisy-shaped;
Their designer is truly a master.

Want trouble?  Just let it run wild.
Want pleasure?  Just wait till you've smiled
At the cute thing it did
And then ran off and hid;
The "it" is a bantling, your child.

From confusion I must have release,
Or I won't know a moment of peace.
Please won't you explain
These matters arcane,
And thus let my bafflement cease?

Common Entrance is something you pass
To gain entrance (if Dad has the brass).
Eton, Westminster, Stowe,
Sherborne, Highgate — all show
That the grammar schools haven't the class.

This word, more archaic than old,
Is as rare and as precious as gold.
To spread round its use, I'll
Assert circumfusile
Is "spreadable round" (so I'm told).

"Going off at you… why? That's the tops!
Not your fault? Red lights–yeah? Traffic stops!
But you don't! You're a jerk!
My car's wrecked! You just smirk!
Lights were green? Pile of crap! Ah… the cops!"

A joke, when it's comically told,
Makes me laugh, even when the joke's old.
So, I've heard it before,
But it still makes me roar
If the manner of telling takes hold.

Electromagnetics strikes fear
In the heart of the mere engineer.
The field is immense,
And its theory is dense
In the quantum mechanical sphere.

There are many good words you should know
En français.  As regards à-propos,
Such remarks might amuse.
If they do, you might choose
To describe them as someone's "bons mots".

# 5: what a good hour for sleeping!
It's the 5th hour past 12—birds are cheeping.
Counting 2, 3, and 4,
I'll get up, feet to floor,
And shut off that accursed alarm's beeping!

Screamed Gretel, "I cannot begin to
Express my disgust!  Where you've been to
Is shown on your Mac
'Cross the top.  Going back
Through the breadcrumbs, I saw what you're into!"

There once was a man named Valentia
Who had typhoid that led to amentia.
He then crawled on all fours
And gnawed at the doors
Feeling certain his name was Rodentia.

To blow bubbles with sugary candy,
Try bubblegum, ever so dandy!
But that bubble might tear
And get caught in your hair,
So I hope you have mayonnaise handy!

One bears weapons. In plate or chain mail, he a-
ppears, never thinking of failure.
The other, a flower,
Bedecks a maid's bower:
The difference between knight and dahlia.

In their backyard my neighbors strode nude.
I objected, "That's terribly crude!"
They replied, "We don't care —
You must bear with us bare:
Just condone it  — quit being a prude!"

There's no way of withstanding the fire
Of critics' unwarranted ire:
"They can't sing. They can't act.
As a matter of fact,
The whole cast would do well to retire."

Now what's next—pay for God-given air?
Just to pump up my tires? How dare...!
Then a charge just for water
Makes me get even hotter!
Do you have fifty cents you can spare?

Find the difference 'tween seven and one?
You'd subtract one from seven.  Not fun.
A 2's complement path
Makes it additive math;
In computerese that's how it's done.

Acolyctine's derived from a plant
With a dangerous sedative slant.
So for making a spell
Or to make beasts unwell,
Wolfsbane works where some other plants can't.

In my search for a cubature unit
For this vessel, I'd faltered; but soon it
Was time to find out
'Bout the pot and its spout.
For my teapot, I'd chosen to spoon it!

"Common Market"  became E.E.C.,
Then just E.C. — can't anyone see?
With each country's accession,
My growing impression
Is E.U. will become U.S.E.

While she's hosting, she seems thrilled to bits.
Morning after, she's more like the Blitz:
Always biliously sniping,
And grousing and griping.
Post-party post-mortems: the pits.

Midnight vigil he keeps by her bed,
Feeling flickers of hope mixed with dread.
But the candle flame flutters,
And sputters... then gutters —
No flicker of life now. She's dead.

Try psychology—study the mind;
Prefix criminal—sadly you'll find
That the brain of a felon
Is likely to dwell on
Those schemes that won't profit mankind.

Scott Foresman did help me attain
Skills in reading that, with me, remain.
Yes, of cheers, I'm a leader
For that old basal reader
And my childhood pals, Dick and Jane.

Compact cars will seat four, that's a cinch,
And some will seat six in a pinch.
But unless you're the sort
Who's exceedingly short—
Extra legroom?  There's nary an inch.

When Europe was still in its dawn
At the time of the great Genghis Khan,
There were only fleet horses,
Instead of new Porsches
Ablaze on the roads out of Bonn.

You can tell I'm a colourful fellow:
All mixed up, every tone (bright or mellow)
I am primed to supply;
For, you see, CMY
Stands for cyan, magenta and yellow.

A young Lithuanian fella
Contracted a case of rubella.
	All his blood drained away,
	'Til his tint turned to grey.
Achromasia's a grim ghostly pallor.

Our guestroom could use fumigation:
Deadly smoke to rid pest infiltration.
Not on roaches or rats,
But your bro's ratty brats,
Whose life's goal is to cause aggravation.

A semiarboreal marten
Found Colby and Brie in a carton.
Now he's  cuttin' the cheese
As he swings through the trees
With a pop-goes-the-weasel-like fartin'.

I am not good at badminton (yet) —
It's a court game I just cannot get.
Some day, I will crack it —
And not crack my racquet
When shuttlecocks scud to the net.

The alcohol found in a drink
Tends to render you drunk, I would think.
If you down six or eight
And you don't feel so great,
You might vomit some up in the sink.

What on earth is this fruit they call bumbleberry?
Exotic elite? Or a humble berry?
It's a bit of a gag,
As the pie with this tag
Has a mixture of fruit — call it jumble-berry.

You pooh-pooh every offer from me
And with each of my schemes disagree.
You concede not a jot,
So I sulk and why not?
I'm dissatisfied, as you can see.

A bomb isn't something inert;
It blows up, and then people get hurt.
If your play bombed, it stunk,
And if you're bombed, you're drunk;
But a bombe is a frozen dessert.

I know lots about shoes (for a guy).
A French heel I would call somewhat high,
Plus it's curved, very chic,
Not the kind I would seek,
Since to wear them I'd not even try.

Abroach is a word well worth knowing
If off to a party you're going.
When done to a cask,
That is all you can ask
Since it means that the wine will be flowing.

From the Hindi "to dwell", the word bustee
Means a village (or slum, bleak and dusty)—
Not a place that is swimmin'
In shapely young women.
Here if lost, hope your Hindi's not rusty.

Our sports club would like to confer
This award, and our members concur
That whoever's the winner
Must appear at our dinner—
That's why all famous players demur.

Nancy Wilson, in Heart, has her notch,
But one lyric of hers is a botch.
If the time she demands
From a watch with no hands,
She's just wearing a digital watch.

On my calendar clearly I see:
"Existentialist Club meets at three."
There I'm doing quite well,
And the folks think I'm swell —
Yes, "The one who's most likely to be."

The Chebsaurus thought school was a bore.
With their folks they were always at war.
They would hang with their crowd
And play music too loud.
Fighting acne was always a chore.

No need for suppressing so manically
What your stomach must issue organically —
It's a bodily function,
So feel no compunction
Whenever you're belching volcanically.

To Cockatoo Creek I am trudgin'
To catch a few fimbriate gudgeon.
Why gobies? I'm beat,
'Cause they're too small to eat.
Dad demands rough-scaled loters, ain't budgin'.

Magisterial, edictal, stern,
The tough judge said, "A deaf ear I turn
To this last mercy plea,"
At which louts danced with glee,
Chanting, "Burn baby, burn baby, burn!"

That control stick you move to and fro
Guides the plane. See those houses below,
How they keep getting bigger?
Pull back! Or you'll dig a
Large hole — it's no time for gung-ho!

If I were the one driving here,
There's no one who'd let out a cheer.
When it's right I go left,
And I'm truly bereft
Of a sense of direction, it's clear.

"This mustard (Dijon?) seems to lack
The flavor I crave on my snack."
"Dijon, that it's not.
But it should be quite hot
In a plaster to put on your back."

In springtime, as growth is resuming,
And rootstocks are busting out, booming,
Why are trees merely budding
From raining and flooding,
But idiots thoroughly blooming?

An elderly poet named Lloyd
Wrote verse that was widely enjoyed.
But when Alzheimer's struck,
He ran out of luck,
And his muse now is simply a void.

He was feline decidedly flat,
Then up spake our beloved little cat:
"Your crystal receiver
Scares this unbeliever.
I won't whisker trial with that!"

You're a woman who works up in town
And you've legs that are sun tanned and brown?
Do you want to aspire
To a smart, cool attire?
City shorts draw a smile, not a frown.

I wish I could speak smooth as butter,
But my words jumble up in a clutter.
I'd sing, never mutter,
Free flow without flutter —
Except for this damnable st- st- st- st-

When OEDILFers arrange that they'll meet
In a café, soon after they greet,
They'll get into the loop,
Order alphabet soup,
And make limericks from letters they eat!

"What's he saying? I can't understand a
Buffoon who says 'Let's 'ave a gander!'
I mean ... what the deuce?
Does he want a male goose?"
"No, a look  — at your pet salamander!"

Since the judge snuffed my scheme with his gavel,
All my dreams have begun to unravel.
He curtailed my mean plan
To sell bombs in Iran:
I am now serving life, and can't travel!

Factive verb use implies a thing's so:
"He's just learned his Jeannine has a beau."
Can he learn things untrue?
Can a verb misconstrue?
Such discussions I choose to forego.

At Thanksgiving Mom shouted, "Dig in!
Let November's food orgy begin!"
But she's like this year 'round—
Meal for meal, pound for pound—
And insulted as hell if you're thin.

The sun's visage appears bit by bit—
"Also rises," as Hemingway writ.
But creep up in the west?
That's just hard to ingest.
That one's not our old Sol, I submit.

I try to assist and advise.
People find me quite helpful and wise.
I offer the knowledge
I learned back in college,
The best man or dog can devise.

These countries aren't picked willy-nilly.
The two in the Andes are hilly.
The other's sublime
Around Carnival time,
Argentina, Brazil, and then Chile.

The project seemed very ambitious:
Rate beauty of bare-butted dishes.
Tom admits, "I'm confessing
Some trouble assessing;
They all look so darn bootylicious."

Tineolas, we're not like the fruit fly
(We concede, orange-eyed, they're a cute fly):
We can't stand foam or froth;
Favorite fodder —  'whole cloth',
We eat dry. Just ask any astute fly.

Almost all situations arising
From attempts to be self-aggrandizing
Have unpleasant results,
Such as sneers and insults,
Both befitting and hardly surprising.

After toking, the failed ayatollah
Said, "Cannabis? Most is crapola;
The exception of course
(And a true tour de force)
Is the bud cluster, known as the cola."

Your dementia evolves by degrees,
As your brain's forming holes like Swiss cheese.
Now you firmly avow
That you suffer "mad cow",
Though you've caught Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

The deuteroplasm (the yolk
In an egg) helps sustain, or to stoke,
As it constantly feeds
The protoplasm's needs,
Which nutrient lack would provoke.

They mustered as if for a war,
Their number well over a score.
But only one hero
(Of men, there were zero)
Could wound the Aetolian boar.

There's Atlantis, submerged in the slime
Of the sea. Once a prize and a prime
Piece of real estate land
That lies buried in sand,
Stuck in rinse-cycle, all throughout time.

Deep in Carlsbad, the dripstone's fantastic;
What feels rigid looks somehow elastic:
Huge stalagmites and drapes—
One just stands there and gapes
At formations both supple and plastic.

What great anguish he started to feel
When his Caddy turned into bent steel.
Then dolorifuge came
When the person to blame
Was his mother-in-law at the wheel.

Each morning I do my ablutions
With various cleaning solutions.
I wash and I scrub
And I cleanse and I rub—
It's one of this year's resolutions.

You'd good cause not to come, so you say,
To the court on a summons that day?
Please explain yourself, sir,
And just hope we concur.
(And I simply forgot's not okay.)

Where my ligaments shrank, my limbs bow.
I've a scarred and banana-like toe.
My deformities issue
From connective-type tissue —
All desmogenous.  Look out below!

Listen, daughter, I seem to recall
"Dark and handsome," you wanted, and "tall."
Get good looks in your man
If you possibly can,
But be sure that he's true, above all.

In a process that's sometimes chaotic,
Acids dropped into mixtures aquatic
Give their protons to bases:
Only one, in some cases,
But the ones that lose two are diprotic.

There's a fuzziness — vision is blurred:
It's a fate that is often incurred
By inebriates who
Never drink just a few;
The whole world's indistinct (so I've heard).

I'm brunette, as you clearly can see—
My hair's dark, as I like it to be.
Some men are more fond
Of a girl who is blonde;
They don't care that she's dumber than I.

The distraught Cajun chef cried out, "Phooey!
My dishes need sausage that's chewy.
I'd load up my fork
With hot chilis and pork
If I only could find good andouille."

Her routine is a loving affair:
Disentwining his sleep-matted hair.
Momma's precious firstborn
Wakes with elflocks each morn—
Boyish tangles—to Mom, debonair.

From an empire that once was far-flung,
Mother England gave birth to her young.
Though good friends and allied,
What cannot be denied:
We're divided by our common tongue.

Her lover, a linguist, would criticize,
And each phrase, anglo-franco-politicize.
"I am sorry, my femme,
But you can't say 'Je t'aime'
Without t', so we always must cliticize."

My grandmother's hair is called blae.
(It's blue with a touch of steel gray.)
What a clever disguise!
But loose lips are unwise —
She's a witness who's hiding away.

He writes verse to his love then withdraws it,
Since his sense of decorum outlaws it.
How I wish he could say,
"Friends and family, I'm gay."
Only mothballs belong in a closet.

Oh, ID, as a theory, you're dismal
When describing things post-cataclysmal;
Messrs. Darwin and Hubble
Can surely cause trouble
For folks with beliefs catechismal.

Define actorish? Some so-called "star,"
Hanging 'round in a theatre bar,
Who invariably tends,
With his thespian friends,
To exclaim: "Lovey dahling! Mwah! Mwah!"

The way Mrs X called me 'Dear'
Was derogatory, that's all too clear.
With disdain in her eyes,
She could barely disguise
The contempt she conveyed with her sneer.

O, that Allah would grant me a wife,
For my loneliness cuts like a knife!
Every day I traverse
The Sahara and curse
At my sad, single bedouin life.

A slothful fat geek I once knew
Refused to get up to go poo.
So I said to him, deadpan,
"There's a thing called a bedpan."
Now he no longer goes to the loo.

Though his name might suggest it, I trust
That the coal tit's not covered in dust.
Like his cousin the blue tit,
This much-paler-hue tit,
Though tiny, is still upper crust.

Did you know wine is sold in a box?
In a bag made of plastic that locks
Out the air that can harm—
Make the wine lose its charm.
Give me box wines the connoisseur mocks!

Though he made her feel small, I admit—
She was scared and so mad she could spit—
I move for acquittal: her
Former belittler
Drooled on himself, I submit.

A French fork's a full beard with a split
At the chin. Pretty sharp, I'd submit.
Said a Johnny Depp fan,
"It looks good on a man,
But on women it's wholly unfit.

Amos: the prophet who speaks
To all Israel, as God's face he seeks.
He warns how God judges
As onward he trudges
With boldness, for many long weeks.

Side orders aren't always nutritious;
They're often, however, delicious.
French fries, mashed potatoes,
Baked beans with tomatoes
To entrées remain adscititious.

With numbers, my dad was adept.
Every challenge he'd gladly accept.
With geometry, say,
He'd solve problems all day,
Then quadratics at night as he slept.

I'm a man with a dog, and I'm blue
Cuz he's old and he's sick, and I rue.
There are times when a man
Does the best that he can,
So I'll do what a man has to do.

Mississippi, the river (not state),
Has a marvelous sub-surface trait.
On the bed—look!—surprise!
Elevations will rise.
The batture might snag boats of much weight.

"What's this debt market??" Grampa sounds vexed.
"You can buy and sell bodies? What next?"
"It's a market for loans,
Not for bags of old bones,"
I reply — but he still seems perplexed.

When the dealer has dealt you your hand,
Just be certain to stand as you've planned;
With two threes and three twos,
You're not likely to lose,
So just stay on your boat—understand?

Greenwich Mean Astronomical Time:
A term awkward and less than sublime,
Which was used to display
Passing hours of the day
Noon to noon at Meridian Prime.

There once was a bookseller, Dee,
Who was giving her books out for free.
Not a penny she earned;
Here's the lesson she's learned:
"A library loans, but not me."

As I poked through the alien dregs
A monster hatched out of the eggs.
This tongueless aglossal
Was simply colossal:
The aglossate ate both of my legs.

Saigon fell to the Commies, a pity,
Although many are now sitting pretty.
Since the war's gone away,
Should you visit today
It's officially Ho Chi Minh City.

Quite ineptly and furtively, E.
Has committed adultery. He,
An adult politician,
May now be a-wishin'
More adultly he'd acted, than free.

An epic impresses with vastness,
And action films thrill us with fastness.
But horror of horrors!
Throw-up-on-the-floorers
Fill film-going hordes with aghastness.

That bus over there from Daytona
Is a chatterer, bone-shaker, groaner.
Such a rattly, rough ride
I could never abide
All the way to Queen Creek, Arizona.

Sue, I'm sorry. It's just as I feared:
Half your hair's on the floor; you look weird.
Your new coif's incomplete
With the fall at your feet.
Like a ewe, you look partially sheared.

Asked an ancient professor of botany:
"Blooms with legs, but no stems—have we got any?"
"All the flowers that grow
Come with stems." "Yes, I know,
But I'm hoping to break the monotony."

Peggy Timberlake, husband at sea,
And John Eaton, "good buddy," made three.
Hubby's death was a boon.
Eaton wed her. (Too soon?)
Wow! How catty some women can be!

They're assistant professors, but please,
Both are saddled with Podunk degrees.
Being wed, they're demanding
Cotenure, a standing
We'll grant since their dads are trustees!

In the Berkshires I choose to abide,
Not in England's renowned countryside,
  But on New England's tract —
  Massachusetts, in fact.
It's a glorious place to reside.

For removal, it helps a great deal
If your nuts are of quality steel.
Otherwise they may rust,
And you'll find that you must
Grind them off with an emery wheel.

"Let's denazify"—that's what you preach—
"Let's get rid of those bullies who teach
So much hatred!" But how
Can we manage it now
Without losing our freedom of speech?

I have fallen in love with you, crayfish.
Let's get intimate now, if I may, fish.
You've no lips, so I'll kiss
Your cute epistome — bliss! —
Just above your pink mouth. (That seems safeish.)

Want investment advice? Got an itch?
Try to cybersquat. Switch to this niche.
Grab some site names and wait.
Pick 'em right and your fate,
When you sell to your mark, will be rich.

"Are you fence-sitting, Mom, or just '-riding?"
I don't know either term, so I'm biding
My time till I know
Which way I should go.
Oh! They both mean "averse to deciding."

The speed of the tempo, it grows,
So faster and faster it goes.
They're playing "Fernando"
With accelerando—
I hope they hang on to their bows!

If you're climbing up high in a tree,
And you fall, landing hard on your knee,
I hope that you would

The ball was defended by Cole
And over the goal-line did roll.
The cross to be borne: a
Quick kick from the corner —
A header, a strike, it's a goal!

Distribute, adapt, reproduce —
All allowed under copyleft use:
Future authors who edit
Must give one due credit;
In the public domain it's let loose.

The shipwright was quickly demoted
When the flaws in construction were noted.
Since that boatbuilder's craft
Had too shallow a draft,
Rafts of problems bobbed up when it floated.

The cashier's disgraced, as she feared,
For the racket that she pioneered.
With her friends she'd connive
To swap tens for a five —
For a change she was caught and cashiered.

I am going! Don't push. Beating feet!
Get your hands off my neck and my seat!
I'll soon fade out of sight
And just blend into night—
That's me, vanishing there, down your street.

Mr. Morse said to Macy's and Gimbel's,
"I've invented some dandy new symbols.
For example, the 'U'
Is like anapest. True?
U should try 'dot-dot-dash' on your timbrels."

Endometrial hyperplasia: that
Is what women might get who are fat.
"Tell me, does it cause cancer?"
"Oh yes", is the answer,
"Though not always, and not off the bat".

At lectures, I'm known for my snores;
They shake both the ceilings and floors.
I know that I'm crass
When I doze off in class,
But I blame my professors, those bores!

Hey, I took an assessment today.
Personality-wise I'm okay.
From a short questionnaire
I completed with care,
Myers-Briggs thinks I'm ISTJ.

A beach bum has stolen a batch
Of sardines from a trawlerman's hatch.
When the harbor patrol
Spots him out on a shoal,
Off he surfs, after waiving the catch.

When water in lakes is anoxic,
To fish, it's perniciously toxic,
'Cause gills are no use,
Like a neck in a noose;
That's how sewage can render a loch sick.

I am finding my faculties stalled;
I'm enraptured, astonied, enthralled;
I'm too awestruck to sigh!
You ask, "Zit-face, but why?"
"Well, that hottie, from English? She called!"

Tell the warden my cellmate agreed
I would sleep on the top bunk, then he'd
Said his word wasn't binding;
His handshake, he's finding,
Should've meant something — just let him bleed.

To most folk a coffee break's seen
As a chance to top up on caffeine,
And, while that is true,
You can pop to the loo,
And no one will know where you've been.

For my stud farm, I don't seek a brisk horse;
No, I'm breeding for friendlier discourse.
I'd forgo a sharp canter
For Mr. Ed's banter;
Shrek's donkey might serve to serve this course.

If you look at crude oil with acumen,
You see volatiles mixed with bitumen.
Do the mocking birds cry
That their ancestors lie
In the asphalt that we are exhumin'?

A drop letter, put in the mail,
In the post office lands without fail.
Then it sits on a shelf;
You retrieve it yourself
(Though you won't have to pay any bail).

Celecoxib shows pain the back door—
Treats inflammat'ry illness galore.
Pain and swelling won't linger
In anus or finger
Or countless more places, I'm sure!

My improved bowling action's the ticket:
A short run, hit my stride at the wicket.
I deliver the ball
(Arm kept straight through it all)
At the stumps, follow through and that's cricket!

Paper bags and some tape — it's a breeze,
And protects you from book-damage fees.
But before paper bags,
Cloth or leather (no rags)
Made a book cover called a chemise.

What a belter — outstanding and thrilling!
Your novel is making a killing.
(But there's no need to tell us
Again. Sure, I'm jealous —
Mine may earn its advance back, God willing.)

Campaigns seem to lengthen each year;
When elections are held, how I fear
That the moment polls close
We'll be hit by new prose,
As fresh promos for hopefuls premiere.

A neophyte nun sits before
A mirror.  She hopes to restore
A flawless complexion.
Astringent perfection
Is needed when helping the pore.

Sean O'Farrell exclaimed with alarm, "A fight?
With a ballot box, boys, and a Carmelite!"
"You fools! It's a gun
That you need, not a nun!"
Whispered Seamus. "He said: bring your Armalite."

"Get lost!" she implored through the jamb.
"But I love you, my shy little lamb!"
She had locked herself in;
So with one sheepish grin,
I assembled my battering ram.

When we get to Nebraska you'll see
Just how frigid a winter can be.
When you feel that wind blow
And it's 40 below,
Little ice cubes you'll see when you pee.

An apprentice with brains of a gnat,
Shown the secret of cutting a mat,
Being shown yet again,
Then replied with disdain,
"Oh yeah. Sure, if you do it like that!"

The Docetic conception of God
Would deny the existence of bod.
The Almighty, they'd say,
Cannot bleed or decay;
Incarnation is just a facade.

Twixt the foc'sle and bridge sits the foredeck,
And the bigger the ship then the more deck.
It's a floor near the front
(That's the sharp, not the blunt)
End of boats — like a go-and-explore deck!

Close your eyes now and try to envision
The rhetorical trick called abscission:
Hear the speaker, mid-clause,
Make a riveting pause....

Had a salad with bad mayonnaise—
'Twas a Caesar I tossed a far ways.
But hors d'oeuvres were a treat:
Cream-puff shells filled with meat.
'Twas the Ides, and I ate two bouchées.

An acrylate's made of acrylic—
With this acid, don't act imbecilic.
It's a resin, a plastic,
And glassy, elastic.
Its properties make life idyllic.

Since we're speaking of animal hides,
All the main etymology guides
Will declare in the buff
Then meant "nude" soon enough.
(Also "naked" and "starkers" besides.)

Semiliquid to start, it will dry
To a cow-patty, cowchip or -pie.
It's a pile of wet poo,
And I stepped in that goo,
Still a cowflop. Cow-pasture, good-bye.

"What's dispensatory?" sneered the old cynic.
"One meaning's  a charity clinic.
The other's a book
In which charlatans look
To find nostrums with labels Latinic."

In this Bradbury novel we learn
A dark message that's hard to discern.
While the temperature rises,
It signals surprises.
First line: "It was a pleasure to burn."

The bell is the captain's (not ship's),
And he rings it (for help with the grips).
When the luggage looms large
It's the bell captain's charge
To dispatch it through bellboys (for tips).

When it's Mendelssohn's music I crave,
Fingal's Cave is my absolute fave.
After visiting Scotland
(His like-it-a-lot land),
He composed this and made critics rave.

Our pondering's over — let's act!
Yes, it's time for this task to be cracked!
Clear the decks — let's prepare!
Not a moment to spare,
'Cause the problem must now be attacked!

What, a lawsuit? Again? Oh, you bum, you!
I get nothing but arguments from you!
Though you think you've a flair
For subpoenas, I swear
Disputatiousness doesn't become you!

I'm feeling quite wasted and weary.
The world looks unfocussed and bleary.
It's not long after noon,
But I'll have to sleep soon,
As my lunch was a little too beery.

To agree, in this instance, is vital.
I think you have copied my title.
Make sure that you get it:
If you don't give me credit
You may find yourself with a cital.

This new heat sensor I will equip
With a well welded steel-copper strip.
Warmed or cooled it will bend
Up or down, and will send
Out the signals for switches to flip.

An effector, the robot has got
At the end of its arm. Though this bot
Handles hedge trimmers, saws,
Jaws, claws, straws, maws and paws,
The three laws make it harmless. (Or not?)

Need an electrocardiograph?
You visit the hospital staff.
They wire you and start
Up a chart of your heart.
If you pass then you'll have the last laugh!

They found on the person of Rex
An engagement ring, love note, and specs.
Now his sad fiancée's
At the morgue in a daze.
She's collecting these special effects.

There's a cult leader living in Wales
Who sleeps on a sharp bed of nails.
You'd think at some juncture
He'd suffer a puncture,
But his novice beneath never fails.

As for ambi-, I'd like to expound.
At the start, it means "both" or "around":
"How's the ambiance there?
Lots of noise filled the air
With ambiguous ambient sound."

I look round and see love fills the eyr.
Dear, I miss you; I've no other care.
Our sweet joy's without end—
On the morrow I'll send
A  red rose that you'll wear in your hair.

Chester tested the cows in his field
To assess their lactational yield,
Their consumption of food,
And how often they mooed.
From this field test no facts were concealed.

From her room she looked out at the park.
When he saw her, it kindled a spark.
Through her window (a casement)
He climbed. To the basement
They went—and made love in the dark.

This plane dive-bombs—a dive (boom! boom!) bomber.
You can rhyme it with calmer or comma,
But don't  sit there somber
And rhyme it with omber
Or comber. Try lama for drama!

Does your mindset produce what we see?
Too conceptualistic for me.
Though ideas might be lyrical,
The real is empirical.
Your theories and mine don't agree.

Whenever I serve a buffet,
There's a chafing dish out on display
To keep food nice and hot.
What an odd name it's got—
It has never rubbed me the wrong way.

When some teen insults grown-ups a lot:
"Old folks suck! Mom and Dad don't know squat!"
The adult in me thinks
Disrespectfulness stinks,
And that kids of this sort should be shot.

I'm just out of my mind, blessed by fate,
So delirious, deep in a state
That's too good to be true.
I'm up high in the blue!
Leave me be—let my joy not abate!

I called my son "angel-face" when,
As a boy of about nine or ten,
He appeared so cherubic.
Now he's acned and pubic;
I won't use that nickname again.

To win captainship's every girl's dream.
Here's the head of the cheerleading team,
Who holds pom-poms up high
While she calculates pi.
She's a mathlete—a bright academe.

What's a cool Anamorpha surprise?
It's their number of legs, I surmise.
Pairs at start?  They have seven,
But, merciful Heaven!
More than double that somehow arise!

My doctors are gravely emphatic:
I'm in serious trouble hepatic.
But for now, one last fling,
Since I don't feel a thing.
For the moment, I'm asymptomatic.

Now these beetles are marvelous things.
In the kingdom of bugs, they're the kings.
This is true of them all,
Except ex-Beatle Paul,
Who is apterous now — without Wings.

"The studio's version is wrong;
My director's cut clearly is strong*.
I am sure you'll concur,"
Said the shameless auteur.
*Self-indulgent and overly long.

For Parliament's cruel execution
Of a tea tax, we sought retribution.
Though we brewed crystal tea
From a shrub, tax would be
An excuse for our cool revolution.

"There's a high horse-drawn carriage," says Jake,
"With four wheels, that is known as a break.
If you see it spelled b-,"
He adds, "r-a-k-e-,
That's permitted and not a mistake."

He presides in the land of the free,
Always trying to rule by decree.
Once the ne'er-do-well son
Of his dad, 41,
He's the shrub who's been dubbed 43.

This true bug is a sucker (not biter),
And, on cereal grasses, a blighter.
Bishop's mitre's  its name
And its main claim to fame.
Did its shape prompt that moniker? Mitre.

If you go to a wedding, think twice
Before throwing great handfuls of rice.
Would you throw dry spaghetti?
Well, no! But, confetti —
Small shaped flakes of paper — is nice.

Good Sir Toby, you belch—you're besotted,
And with Aguecheek frequently spotted.
As you're witty and shrewd
(If at times a bit lewd),
Poor Malvolio fell when you plotted.

Private Highgate deserted the gore
In the Battle of Mons, and then bore
Through his court-martial shame
At just eighteen, the name:
First firing-squad death of the war.

The artillery guns are arrayed
On the hill overlooking the glade.
When they blow, they'll bestow
On the foe down below
Loads of woe—with a full cannonade.

The hornbill's immense epithema
Makes its beak, among avians, prima.
This casque is, in essence,
A horny excrescence—
Just part of Mom Nature's great schema.

When we dramatized Humpty, we woke
The emotions of kind-hearted folk.
When he oozed mock albumen,
He seemed almost human.
His bleeding fake yolk was no joke.

Told the barkeep, "Ah'm shtrickly a cash player."
Quite concerned, he asked, "Are you a rash player?"
Ah said, "No, you shmart joker,
It'sh not about poker—
Shee mah trumpet? Ah'm really a brash player!"

Asked the Duke, "Where's our next head-to-head?"
And Napoleon Bonaparte said,
"Waterloo." With a grin,
The Duke said, "If I win,
St Helena's quite nice, so I've read."

An eleve (pupil or learner)
May not be a genius like Turner.
For example, at school,
I liked acting the fool—
Joked around, but of work was a spurner.

Bob was out for a stroll one fine day,
When a blond short-haired girl looked his way.
She was charming and sweet,
And her bob pretty neat,
And his heart was quite stolen away.

Looks like something I said got you pissed,
But I'll ask you to cease and desist.
You should never have led off
By biting my head off.
You yelled at me, cursed me and hissed.

It's the septum that's found in the land snail—
The epiphragm—part of this grand snail
That prevents desiccation
Through the snail's hibernation.
You'll find it, some day, in your canned snail.

Something porcine exhibits its porkiness.
A wood plug in a bottle shows corkiness.
If you're dumb, gauche, and loud,
Then shout out in a crowd,
You are proudly displaying your dorkiness.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf made his name
With a more and more doubtable claim,
Yet by talking such rot,
He has wangled a spot
In the Figure of Speech Hall of Fame.

Richard begs me, "Come on, what's your trick
To avoid being airsick?" "Well, Rick,
 It's a cinch," I reply,
 "Take a train and don't fly;
It's less bumpy (though also less quick)."

You can count with your fingers and toes;
But you only have twenty of those.
So how is it one counts
More abundant amounts —
With one's copious friends queued in rows?

Cried the feverish Diderot, "Right —
Clear the cobwebs and let there be light!
But I'd better get cracking —
Can't write this big whacking
Encyclopédie overnight."

"My life ish a shamblesh," slurred Jack.
All his friends, as if one, answered back,
"If you'd give up your drinking,
Then clear-headed thinking
Would soon put your life back on track."

My first wicket was worth an ovation;
The next ball another — elation!
My bowling's not ace,
But I'd bagged a cool brace
That produced an expectant sensation.

Double flowers, considered a gain,
Make regular blooms look mundane.
But why, in creation,
Such chance aberration?
Spare petals are hard to explain.

Using basswood, and watching the grain,
Carve a carousel horse — head and mane,
Legs and tail. With the parts
Glued together, it starts
To look good. (Painting detail's a pain.)

All the molecules found in a mole
Fill a twenty-two-liter-sized hole.
Avogadro's amount
Is the name of their count
That gives chemists a sense of control.

A cruive is this hovel (don't sneer);
Or this pigsty, or pen (for a steer);
This low fence (none disturbs
My few veggies and herbs);
Or this salmon-coop placed in a weir.

As exotic and sweet as a mango
Was the gal at the bar in Durango.
All my wiles I applied:
"Dance, cariño?" I sighed,
And we pranced in a fancy fandango.

Will Wanda who wanders afield
With the weapons she'll skillfully wield
Be so willowy-lithe
While she's swinging a scythe
That the grasses will willingly yield?

If I sell you my land, you'll agree
To maintain my magnolia tree.
Don't ignore my concern,
Or the clause of return
Reverts ownership right back to me.

"There's a ghost in my alphabet soup!"
I cried to my mom with a whoop.
"It's telling me, 'Ooooooo!'"
"Now, knock it off, you!
It's anelli," said Mother, "you dupe!"

How bitter the tears that she's wept
O'er the name that she's sorely yclept.
With a last name like Lear,
The name Shanda is queer.
How can parents have been so inept?

My friend Dave has a devilish streak,
And a jest or a trick he will seek
To unleash on his foes
Four times monthly. Each goes
By the label of "Gleek of the Week."

Our town's Christmas display, a large spruce
And three reindeer, draws kudos profuse.
I'm in charge of the four,
But I like the tree more.
I deduce that the spruce won't break loose.

To the timid (but nonetheless coachable),
Many topics are wholly unbroachable
When meeting a lady.
But this won't sound shady:
"Beg your pardon, I find you approachable."

You do not want this fight to begin;
I suggest it is time to give in.
I will end this debate
With my height and my weight:
I am bigger than you, so I win.

Here's our lute workshop; Mel's at the helm.
We make instruments, using the elm,
As its elmwood is sturdy.
See this new hurdy-gurdy?
Mel's carving and style overwhelm.

Not too sure if a baby's in there?
A ballottement will tell you what's where.
Give a push from below:
If it floats back, you know
That the couple will soon have an heir.

Tom's young female horse promptly sped
When he'd told her to slow down instead.
"Whoa, filly!" he blurted,
But onward she spurted.
"Defiant," Tom woefully said.

A gambrel roof—we give this name
To a roof wherein this is the aim:
The pitch of each slope
Has two gradients. The hope?
Greater headroom obtained 'neath its frame.

My jacket is made out of fleece,
A moreen that won't  wrinkle or crease.
So it's crushproof, but not
That resistant to what
Was just dropped by those low-flying geese.

The pizzas that other folks favor
Have a cheesy or mushroomy  savor.
But for toppings, I am
More a craver of ham
And of meats with a bacony flavor.

"If you leave out the normal conjunctions,"
Said Pete, "then your sentence still functions.
It's asyndeton's aim
In this lexical game,
As in: 'railway tracks, meeting points, junctions'."

Think it's colic? A case of entralgia?
What? Your stomach? The pain is gastralgia?
Well, your tests are emphatic—
It's diaphragmatic.
Young man, you have diaphragmalgia!

"This antelope chop's overdone,
So I'll head for the blind with my gun"—
Though a blaubok I sought,
There were none to be caught;
You'd have thought I just ate the last one.

When it's wintertime out in Nebraska,
Or it's slick on the ice of Itaska,
Mom said we should use—
What's the word for those shoes
Made of rubber? Don't know, but alaska.

You can study a man through fluoroscopy,
Or endoscopy—even coloscopy,
But it won't tell you what
Kind of fellow you've got.
I can tell at a glance—anthroposcopy.

My dentist's routine never varies
(Immune from financial vagaries).
No credit, no checks,
'Cause he always expects
That his business is pure cash and caries.

The A. F. of L. - C. I. O.
Says a union's the right way to go.
But Wal-Mart is pissed
And its leaders insist
They're not needed. (But what would they know?)

I grow old; my days last but a minute.
The pantaloon phase: I am in it.
My once-manly physique
Has declined and grown weak.
And the worst part? I trill like a linnet.

"I like sweet-smelling things," said the dude,
"And, of course, there is good-smelling food.
Sense the mouth-wat'ring smell
Of a steak that's cooked well!
(Plus a perfume-soaked girl in the nude.)"

Now here is a heartening story
Heard on visiting old Tobermory:
Duncan's head, once quite hairless,
Now sports, in moods careless,
A toupé—it's his fine crowning glory.

I shall buy at the duddery, Ruth,
Woolen cloth for a waistcoat. In truth,
That fine houndstooth, I think,
Suits me well, in bright pink.
Then we'll hie to a clothier's booth!

Every novel is nothing but fluff,
And your grammar and syntax are rough.
You've made crap your career.
From your writing it's clear
That I just can't dispraise you enough.

His life is now broken. The pain
And indignity drove him insane.
This drug is a bitch —
Casts a spell to bewitch,
Then it's too late to switch: crack cocaine.

Airy nymphs are celestial, empyreal,
Ethereally sweet, immaterial,
So divine, sublime, pure,
Subtly precious for sure,
Not at all like a bowl of cold cereal.

My restaurant's small, but it's hot.
It's the theater crowd's favorite spot.
Sure, it's got its detractors,
But the critics and actors
Come to gab, grab a bite and just squat.

A meal? No, it's more like a feast!
There are twenty four platters, at least.
It's an ambigu. Why?
Comes the whole food supply
In the blink of an eye (word's deceased).

Jean-Jacques' death was a terrible blow.
He left all of his mistresses dough.
They debated all night—
How to bury him right—
As they wanted the rite comme il faut.

Though their gene bank endued me with health,
My parents provided no wealth,
So, a cat burglar, I
Must amend that, or try,
As I burgle folk's houses with stealth.

Panurus biarmicus: it
Is the Latin for one kind of tit.
Decidedly weird—
It's blessed with a beard—
Called a bearded tit by a Brit.

"Filled with custard, my doughnut," said Cher,
"Is a tasty delight." "Au contraire,"
Replied Sonny. "You're wrong.
Looking endwise it's long.
What you've got is a chocolate eclair."

Shall we try a short feather cut, hon?
It's a do that's both easy and fun.
And (let's cut to the chase)
It will frame that sweet face.
You won't know yourself after we're done.

The cheeks of the anthropoid bottom
Saved humankind face when we got 'em.
The odd parts they conceal
Would, perhaps, make us feel
Quite embarrassed should ever we spot 'em.

My child's room used to be clean,
But that changed when he rounded thirteen.
Now with nary a care,
Things are strewn everywhere,
And to enter you need a vaccine!

The anatomist said, "Thank you, dear.
When I look from the front or the rear
At your body all day,
It's a wonderful way
To excel in my chosen career."

With old age I've become presbyopic.
In your records, the print's microscopic,
But it says, in your case,
That your gland's out of place.
Your adrenal, my dear, is dystopic.

The adhesive refused to adhere.
It wasn't too sticky, 'twas clear,
But the chap at 3M
Who had failed at this chem
With Post-it Notes saved his career.

Dynamism: energy theories
Explaining the force. Still have queries?
You need a new model
(Don't heed that old twaddle).
Mine's being released as a series.

"An air mattress, surely," said Kate,
"Is a must when you're out on a date.
But it takes lots of huffing
And plenty of puffing
To make it completely inflate."

"A saving of labour or space"
Is a meaning I've not had to face.
Though compendium's heard,
Such a use of the word
Won't occur in a modern-day place.

Might the golden, the healer suffice?
But Apollo was not always nice:
Plague-dealer, cruel master
And long-distance blaster.
But why the destroyer of mice?

Look, I know you feel mortified. Fine!
But you drank all my fortified wine:
The marsala, the sherry…
What made you most merry?
The tawny, you portified swine!

A noisemaking nuisance named Neville
Is randy and ready to revel.
But his spouse, who's a grouse,
Says their bi-level house
(Just two floors) ain't for raising the devil.

Though specifics I want you to say,
You approach in a roundabout way.
There's a bush that you're beating
About.  Patience fleeting,
I give up on your answer today.

A cell's chemotactic ability
Depends on its having motility.
With chemokinesis
The motion increases:
Utility stems from agility.

So courteously he behaves:
Not content with unmannerly waves,
He will cross over roads
To carry the loads
Of old ladies not far from their graves.

First she noisily bolted a rabbit,
But then, wasn't able to nab it.
You can quickly see how
Too much Bassett and chow
Make it hard to make hunting a habit.

Do Indians feel at a loss
When using the measure called coss —
The unit of length
With the drawback (not strength)
That it varies? They don't give a toss.

"Got no room; got no food; I don't know,"
Squatter said, "how this tune ought to go."
Said the traveler, "I'll
Show you." "Here, stay a while—
Have a meal, a good bed. Take my bow."

Seems that emmet's an old word for "ant."
Its usage today is quite scant,
But should tourists annoy
It's a word to employ
Down in Cornwall, as part of your rant.

The Army has soldiers who fight.
The Navy has sailors, all right.
The Marine Corps, I'm told,
Has marines, very bold,
While the Air Force has airmen in flight.

When liquor is aged, as in wood,
Some liquid is lost, which is good.
The angel's share dissipates.
A seraph participates.
Can a spirit steal spirits? It could.

They annoy me: I think they're a pain,
And their thoughtlessness drives me insane.
At the grocery store
They're the ones who buy more
Than twelve things in the ten-item lane.

Athabascans are hunters of game.
Taking reindeer and moose is one aim.
Catching shellfish and salmon,
They never see famine.
Our junk food just isn't the same.

This middle-sized tome in my hand
Has a list of all words in this land
(At least most, let us say),
With their spellings, what way
They're pronounced, and for what they can stand.

She sees little bugs on the wall!
She thinks there's a troll in the hall!
The doctor will fix it—
I hope he can nix it.
ABS is the cause of it all!

"He is mean, he is coarse, he is dumb,"
Says my mother, "The guy is a bum!"
So she  bombinates, right?
That's "insults him"? Not quite!
It's a word that means "buzz, drone, or hum."

The term drill rod's employed in two roles:
First it's steel used for drills when one's goals
Are both hardness and toughness—
To pierce the rock's roughness—
And it drives the long drill that bores holes.

My hair color's called dirty blonde;
Of this name I have never been fond.
It's light brown, and it's clean,
With gold highlights and sheen.
Call it dirty? With tears I'll respond.

It's surrounded by beautiful beaches,
And a look on the map quickly teaches:
This sea's not a menace
From Corfu to Venice,
Where its largest diameter reaches.

According to one of my guides,
The chapter house grandly provides
The Lincoln Cathedral
A room, decahedral —
Stained glass adorns nine of ten sides.

"Pilar sheath acanthoma. Don't fear,"
Said the doctor, "it's easy to clear
With a quick little snip.
Keep a stiff upper lip."
"I don't want one, doc. That's why I'm here!"

"Fix this photo of Moon in your mind.
She's the kid we've been ordered to find."
Some celebrity's brat
Is job one, and that's that.
To long hours of work I'm resigned.

It's so easy, just clap; it's a snap.
Light go on, lights go off when I clap.
But they also turn off
Or turn on when I cough,
Send this clapper switch off. It's just scrap.

If you need to cool off, or fear pain,
Chloroethane can help keep you sane.
"Five H's, two C's,
And one Cl, please!"
Shall eternally be your refrain.

Abegg's rule deals with chemical valence,
Which explains why it's had no assailants
To put it in verse.
I'll do better, not worse,
Once I find the right kind of inhalants.

For a bridle and bit, people should
Be aware: using leather is good.
If you utilize branks,
Don't expect any thanks
From your horse—it's a muzzle of wood.

I'd assumed that the word meant "musician
Playing rock," or a kid with that mission,
But I found (what a shocker!)
The true Boston rocker
Is a rocking chair—Boston edition.

His wife Deena serves undercooked meats
And creamed corn—that's the food Steven eats,
As that's all she prepares.
"It's a shame," he declares.
"Peas and carrots, for me, would be treats."

The queen's coronation ('08)
Hit a roadblock.  She'd just have to wait.
No such barrier's seen
On the road to '16:
Next in line by design.  It's her fate.

The criminal crackerjack Cramer
Is a fraud, I'm afraid. He's a framer,
Tagging me with his crime
When I'm faultless this time!
He's a blatantly black-hearted blamer.

I enjoy children's games very much;
I've been studying jump-ropes and such.
When kids double the rope,
It is harder to cope—
Only experts perform double Dutch.

Your wife's slyness and stealth's got her far.
Such furtiveness, son, is on par,
I must say, with your own.
With hard work, it has grown,
And you've set a high sneakiness bar.

To our  fancy-dress ball I will ask 'er,
Hoping Marni's attire, as a masker,
Won't be genus Aptornis.
"I'll be Epiornis—
That bird from," she said, "Madagascar."

A region that shares the same air
Because of topography there,
Combined with the clime
(I've learned writing this rhyme),
Is an airshed, as you were aware.

An old fellow was bludgeoned, and dead.
A prime suspect was tracked where he fled.
He'd a hammer in hand,
But denied it was planned—
"It was mallet aforethought," they said.

The letters you see on your screens
Are encoded by standard routines.
Using ASCII, some nerds
Can turn bits into words:
They build characters using machines.

You're a brain sucker, thriving on work
Done by others, which drives me berserk.
Before they reveal
Their results, you just steal
And pretend they're your own, lazy jerk!

On CDs, there's an extra attraction:
It's the spectrum from light's interaction
With lines closely scribed,
So it's groovily vibed —
A phenomenon known as diffraction.

I'm denouncing (So please, turn the mike on!)
Flagrant falsehoods, like 'No K in Nikon'.
Ditto: 'No X in Nixon'.
As well, get a fix on —
You're misguided by 'No C in icon'.

My toddler's full diaper was droopy,
And from here I could tell it was poopy.
Now let's hope it's his mom
Who defuses this bomb:
I can't stand when they're sticky and goopy.

Disorderedness reigns in my house,
And it's all on account of my spouse,
Who, tragic to say,
Never puts stuff away:
Another fine reason to grouse.

A lone werewolf twice shot in the paw
And half-dead at Doc Frankenstein's door
Cried, "Desilverization!
Don't waste time on sedation!
Or I'll die — as I have done before."

Mrs Finch is a family friend—
A dear friend I can't quite recommend.
Though she's loved by my mum,
And my dad's her best chum,
The old bird drives me right round the bend.

At a disco, you're in with a chance
Of romance, that may start with a dance
And a chat at the bar—
Though I doubt you'll get far
With spilled drink down the front of your pants.

See this vase? It's antique: Elizabethan.
An investment, it's prime for bequeathin'.
It's 400 years old,
And it's inlaid with gold.
(Grandma bought it to keep her false teeth in.)

My forebears were all overweight—
A persistent familial trait.
A hard fast for a week
Merely sallowed my cheek,
So pipe down while I empty my plate.

When he begged to, just once, share her bed:
"In your dreams, pig. I'd rather be dead!"
Still, his hope springs eternally:
He pursues her — infernally,
Determinedly stumbling ahead.

How much time does the average collision
Between bat and ball last? The decision
To pass or to swing
At a pitch with some zing
Will depend on the batter's keen vision.

Although Nigel's a horrible churl,
He has scant trouble getting a girl.
How's a boor who's so grating
This lucky in dating?
(No mystery there: he's an earl!)

Compared to the force of a gale,
A sailing ship's naturally frail,
And, being thus blasted,
Risks being dismasted
By failing to furl enough sail.

Our King Bozo is some kinda clown.
We should tell 'im to get outa town.
Let's decrown de guy now.
How to do it? Here's how:
We'll just say, "Take a hike—leave de crown."

When the style's alla prima, it's quick:
Just one layer of paint—not too thick.
For the artist, this try's
All he gets 'cause it dries
Very fast and the images stick.

Seeing stadiums filled when he stumps
Gives detractors a case of the grumps.
With a bilious disdain,
They all sulk and complain
As support for their candidate slumps.

I love food, so much so that I'm chubby.
"She eats like a pig," says my hubby.
True, I'm willing to chew
On a maggot or two:
I love grub even when it is grubby.

The bonds in a pyrrole aren't static.
In phosphole, it gets more traumatic.
A bigger strange face
Keeps those bonds more in place
So that arsole rings aren't aromatic.

He was calling from jail, but refrained
From explaining his lateness; it pained
Him to urge, "Have your tea,
Darling.  Don't wait for me.
I'm delayed." What he meant was detained.

I expected reactions profound
When my thesis was handed around
At my masters defense,
But what broke the suspense
Were guffaws—a cachinnatory sound.

I've the bod of a model; it's cute.
It's cute, and it's stuffed in my boot.
Not my footwear, you punk;
It is stuffed in the trunk
Of my car — ain't late models a hoot?

For some reason, her simple demand
(In her day) was thought way out of hand.
"Voting's not just for guys!
You can learn, fairness-wise,
From Wyoming, that wild western land."

I claim authorship here on the spot,
Having all of this limerick begot.
In authority's state
I might carry more weight,
But authoritativeness I've not.

When you're tallying chunks of meniscus
In your knee that you tore throwing discus,
And the abacus here
Is unwieldy, you fear,
Use the handy, petite abaciscus.

I suppose I should plan on resuming
Some attention to personal grooming.
People constantly stare
At my teeth, nails, and hair
'Cause they're nasty. Or so I'm assuming.

Who's that creature who swings through the trees
Like a man on a flying trapeze?
That capuchin is spunky
(Not the monk, but the monkey);
So at ease that his fleas feel the breeze.

When the formula's wrong for your glass
Then the alkalis often will pass
To the surface and cause
Minute crizzling; these flaws
Make your heirloom now worthless, alas.

When you lower your sail to surrender,
You amain, yield your ship, don't defend 'er.
When amain (at full speed),
You're in trouble indeed,
If three sheets to the wind on a bender.

Although analog was all the rage,
We are now in the digital age.
To convert 'cross the board,
You may wish to record
Data using an ADR gauge.

As I took a long leap off the pier,
The danger at once became clear.
All the sharks had their bibs on;
Said one:  "I've got dibs on
His drumsticks—now open that beer!"

Yearly rental increases have stopped,
And for some tenants, rents have been dropped.
The reason's clear cut:
There's developed a glut
In the market— the prices have topped.

Captivity's deadly. Repression
Provokes a consuming obsession
With ways to escape,
And when tactics take shape
And then fail, I will turn to aggression.

The work of the genius Brahms
Is brimful of musical charms.
His Symphony 2
Is a pastoral brew—
Good for calming down cattle on farms.

Understanding the term  gender bender?
This is one who's a vocal contender
That you need not conform
To a birth-assigned norm;
Of such rights a committed defender.

I'm sorry this sounds a bit gruff,
But "stuffing" is bread that you stuff
INSIDE of the bird.
I don't care what you heard—
Call it "dressing", I'll leave in a huff.

Just reflect upon Orgel's Rule Two,
If surprised how diversity grew:
Though it cares not a fart
And creates without art,
Evolution is smarter than you.

I hit Coney Isle wit' me goil,
And we gave the old Cyclone a whoil.
We agreed pretty quick
That it made us both sick,
So we rode it, according to hoil.

When a mammal's cetaceous, it means
It's aquatic, like humpbacks, baleens,
Or belugas—all whales.
Horizontal, flat tails
Are propelling these swimming machines.

Coxalgia, or pain in the hip,
Makes it hard for a person to skip.
Pain meds might help you cope
But if not, there's still hope—
Hip replacement! (It's well worth the trip.)

My wife is exceedingly thin,
Just a skeleton covered by skin.
I'm as fat as a pig,
Many sizes too big,
So for weight, I'm the yang to her yin.

It's an areca nut, or the seed
Of the betel palm—just what I need.
With the leaves of the pepper
And lime, it's a prepper
For bowels to move at full speed.

Galop's GAL-up, guh-LOH or guh-LOP.
Step and slide to the side. You may stop
For a brief greet-your-neighbor.
Don't try to belabor
The dancing with talk. You might drop.

An appointment is once again missed,
For distractions the maid can't resist.
"It's happened again,
She's the brains of a hen!"
The queen is majestically pissed.

A database guy named McClaskey
Sent a UTF file to Pulaski.
P. replied, "It's too long.
Can you tell me what's wrong?"
M. replied, "I dunno, but I'll ASCII."

Thanks for waiting; I'm nearly OK.
I awoke a bit dauncy today—
Somewhat under the weather.
But I'll pull it together,
And our journey can get underway.

Abiogenically, things can't give birth.
You need life to give birth on this Earth.
Could two cannonballs, say,
Raise a family? No way!
(Unless as a subject of mirth.)

Crinigerous: with hair; being hairy.
A circumstance some might find scary.
But a man who's hirsute
Might not be a brute
But simply a little contrary.

When the ash-breasted tit-tyrant bird
Looks to mate, there's one hen that's preferred.
It's the black-breasted tit
That he'll look for and git
For some S&M frolics; my word!

There was so much to do — deadlines piled
Upon deadlines. It all got so wild
That we got way behind.
Though departments combined
To work faster, the client got riled.

Your douceur is so hard to describe.
The word's French and, like words of that tribe,
Offers meanings that smart
People choose à la carte,
Such as "gentleness"; "sweetness"; "a bribe".

My ex, who was given to gibing,
Curled her lip at my drunken exscribing:
"Your copying's flaky.
Your handwriting's shaky.
Wanna be an ex-scribe? Keep imbibing."

If historical landmarks you seek,
Out in Portland we've something unique:
Benson Bubblers you'll see.
Drinking water flows free
And they're cleaned every day of the week.

At Frankenstein's Monster Supply,
I think that their prices are high
For a Hydra or Janus;
As their faces are heinous,
A disomus (two-bodied) I'll buy.

There once was a lawyer from Ayr,
Whose new clients, a quarrelsome pair,
Tried contesting the split.
Though the will was legit,
They still whined when they got their fair share.

A historic and sound rationale
Led to building the Cape Cod Canal,
Which has helped shelter ships
And shorten some trips
Around that vacation locale.

A faggot walked into a bar,
But before he could get very far,
The bartender laughed,
"I got nothing on draught
For a bundle of sticks — au revoir!"

A lib booked a room at the Omni
And emerged the next morning pro-Romney—
Which proves that Fox News
Can conservatize views,
And is lousy at curing insomney!

He scarfs sesame bagels at seven,
Has a hunk of halvah at eleven,
Bathes biscotti regina
With hummus tahina—
That boy believes benne's from heaven!

In aerospace, aerospike rockets,
No matter the sockets or sprockets
Or money or brain
Power mustered, remain
Insufficient. Add more, deeper pockets?

Under Dubya, the high price of gas
Had the media riding his ass.
Gas went down.  Now we're back
Where we were.  No attack
On Obama.  He's given a pass.

If Mary's is big, how 'bout Janet,
Whose arse is as large as a planet?
Two buttocks, like moons,
Play celestial tunes
When she farts — you'd best hope she don't fan it!

To Windhoek, the farmers bring maize,
And the co-op they bring it to pays.
With their agsterskot paid,
All the boers have it made,
'Til another year's harvesting days.

Tell the kid that his mom's got cirrhosis;
Say his dog died of phobic mycosis;
Make him cry, for God's sake,
So we'll get this damn take —
Whatcha mean, he's got dacryostenosis?

Our forefathers fled persecutionists,
Bonding as bold revolutionists.
They fashioned a charter
To govern them smarter.
We people are all constitutionists.

We adapt or we die; change is good.
I'd stay put, be content, if I could.
If swift time would stand still
(Which we know's not the drill),
I'd be glad just to stay where I stood.

My brother has died. He is dead
And no longer alive (as I said).
He was just under fifty,
Less thrifty than shifty—
The loan-sharks re-structured his head.

A collop's not meant for the plough,
It's the size that the land will allow.
It's the pasture that's needed
To keep livestock feeded —
Six sheep eat the same as one cow.

The Florida orange is sweet,
Like the Jaffa, a health-giving treat,
But you won't make the grade
If you serve bigarade,
From Seville—they're too bitter to eat.

There were skaters renamed Frick and Frack.
There were famed Car Talk hosts  Click and Clack.
At the warehouse, we two
Who fill orders for you
Are so proud to be called Pick and Pack.

A keen encyclopaedist am I,
As I write encyclopaedias. Why?
It widens our knowledge
Like courses at college—
Today or perhaps by and by.

If for a vacation you seek
To be hiking and climbing all week,
Then tackling this hill
Might just give you a thrill—
Annapurna, the tenth-highest peak.

Come and visit the Image Boutique
For the alphabet logos you seek.
At first glance curving lines,
They're all-letter designs,
Clever calligrams, each one unique.

When I write to the maestro, Armando,
I cringe to see how he'll respond—oh,
I just know I'll behold
Words in caps or in bold,
'Cause with him, every note is forzando!

A flash fire burned — deflagration.
It turned violent, blew up — detonation.
This transition occurred
When the flame speeds were spurred.
Death by blast pressure, not immolation.

Said the strings to the woodwinds, "Beware.
Hold your hat and grab on to your chair;
Gird your loins, plug your ears,
Check for loose chandeliers —
In ten measures, the brass is ablare."

Orson Welles starred in Citizen Kane,
Where he showed C.F. Kane in his pain
When he wrote a review …
Welles directed the crew—
As an actor-director, that's plain.

Woes urethral?  Could be this'll cure ya.
Some doctors advise (I assure ya)
Drinking cranberry juice
So the bugs will vamoose,
For it's said they can't stand aciduria.

"Prepare for dispatchment, you fiend!"
Said the swashbuckling bandit who leaned
O'er his trembling foe.
That thief's stab, to his woe,
Killed the enemy's bird as it preened.

Here there's labor abuse, exploitation.
For that, there's a sad explanation:
Protections are poor.
Fact'ry owners ignore
The few laws; there's no true regulation.

Some annelids (earthworms and leeches)
That crawl in the sea and on beaches
Lack organs like gills.
Oh, the wonders and thrills
You receive when a limerick teaches!

It's the Spook's winter house, I am sure.
See? It's there in that clough of the moor.
In that deep, steep ravine,
He keeps witches unseen
And behind iron bars. We're secure.

England's golden boy lost — Rupert Brooke —
Wrote of love, died too young, closed the book,
Leaving youth a brief page
From a less jaded age,
Torn by war and the toll that it took.

"My political foe is a jerk!
Around schoolyards he'll frequently lurk!"
This attack ad you'll see
All next month on TV.
I don't like them but, sadly, they work.

This fungus I'd call allochoric;
It grows on the bones of old Yorick,
And I'm getting a hunch
It invaded my lunch.
Call the pharmacist! Send paregoric!

"Cytochemistry's very complex,"
Said that hunky professor called Rex.
"Many compounds will function
Through pairing—conjunction."
I thought, "Must he talk about sex?"

Will cold Death on us stealthily creep
So we pass from this life while we sleep?
While we wait, let's get drunk
As that infamous skunk,
Ere our thoughts get more dark and more deep.

This limerick is slightly defectious.
The pansy's the state flower of Texas.
Pigs can fly (and they know it).
I am a fine poet.
The defects — well, by my count there are about six, yes?

When I wanted to marry Sophía,
She was dead set against the idea.
So much so, on the day
I proposed, she turned gay,
Changed her name, and ran off to Korea.

When disruptive kids rant, rave and run,
And their folks say they're just having fun,
It leads me to note
My best friend, and I quote:
"I enjoy little children — well done!"

A word and the thing that it shows
Are related—but how? No one knows.
Primal fact, or convention?
Such bones of contention
Have had people coming to blows.

A canner's a woman or man
Who can seal or make airtight a can,
Give a slip that is pink
To a worker, or sink
A three-pointer to shut up a fan.

In accounting, she made a huge error;
Being new, she was stricken with terror.
It's an honest mistake
Any person could make—
I would hope for her sake that they spare her.

There are auditory nerves in our ears
That connect with the brain, it appears.
Neural impulses flow
Through them both—this is so
We can hear and not fall on our rears.

"Charles X?" Susie asked, "Who is he?
Malcolm's brother, or dad, might he be?"
I replied, "Not a chance!
Both of Sweden and France,
He was king." "Is that possible?" "Oui!"

There was a young woman named Nina,
Whose holiday plans were between a
Soothing trip to the sea,
And a weekend to ski.
The place to get both?  Argentina!

The new mizzen we added is set,
But I think that's the best it'll get.
However we rig it,
Our ship's not a frigate—
So frig it, we sail a corvette.

A descriptive clause?  Got it down pat!
Not restrictive, it starts not with that,
But with comma, then which.
But it can be a bitch
To know when to use which.  So let's chat.

Here's a gift knit for Junior, your nipper.
It's a pair, each secured by a zipper.
You look puzzled, so far—
Don't you know what they are?
Each is calceolate (shaped like a slipper).

Whenever some country obtains
Aircraft carriers, leaders take pains
To declare, while expensive,
They're purely defensive,
These huge floating runways for planes.

The boo birds are out in full force.
From their home team they want a divorce.
Every year it's a bust.
You'll hear shouts of disgust.
What a joke! (Detroit Lions, of course.)

"Very well," I reply, "since you ask;
What I meant when I gave you that task,
Was not just move your tail,
But that large butt of ale:
Move your butt or, you might say, your cask."

Auriphrygia graces my gown,
From the neckline and bodice on down.
A fine golden thread
To white satin's been wed,
By the finest designer in town.

They know how to scream, sleep and eat,
To fill diapers, and suckle a teat.
And your finger they'll hold
With a grip uncontrolled:
That's the grasp reflex. Isn't it sweet?

Said a chain-smoking fellow named Martin
(Tried to quit, and his progress was chartin'),
"Doing well, but perhaps
I might have a relapse—
Better stop at the shop for a carton!"

The blueskins (their skin wasn't blue)
Held a strict puritanical view.
Presbyterians, grave
In the way they'd behave,
Were a solemn bunch.  Fun was taboo.

Pierre told his son, "It will pay,
To ship off my nouveau Beaujolais.
From the lemming-like Yanks
We will get many francs
For young wine of fermented gamay."

Conjecturers? Terrible stress
Can progress if a terrible mess
Is the outcome of placing
Your trust in them, basing
Your plan on a terrible guess.

The alpine zone: one I adore
With its beautiful mountains that soar.
It has glaciers strong,
From its heights some are long,
As they flow to the deep valley floor.

Decumaria barbara twines
Up our Warrington, Florida pines.
So, in June, when your Spec. you marry,
Be wed beneath decumary:
Fragrant hydrangea vines.

If Tinkerbell's mom tells her fairy tales,
Do hairdressers tell their kids hairy tales?
Do vampires tell scary tales?
Do grizzlies tell beary tales?
Do Guernseys with calves tell them dairy tales?

Cunning Colchian king, that Aeetes:
Set hard tasks, after Jason's entreaties.
	All the jobs, Jase did fine:
	"That gold fleece is now mine!"
Took the skin, glad he ate all his Weeties!

A thrifty young temptress from Shoreham
Made newspaper hotpants, and wore 'em.
When news got around,
Male admirers soon found
That the news seemed no longer to bore 'em.

See the engine spin 'roun' an' aroun';
See the piston — she go up an' down.
It's the bottom or top
Where she might want to stop —
Call 'em dead points; it's hard to reboun'.

Santa, Mom needs a coat and a toaster.
For me, Santa, please send a coaster.
On my sled I'd let go,
Swiftly slide through the snow…
But do Mom first: our top turkey roaster.

Does Ann wear her suit well? You can't fault her:
She causes men's courses to alter.
At a glimpse of her, Max
Simply stops in his tracks:
Yes, that neck-secured top is a halter.

As for plants foliaceous (in brief),
The adaxial parts of each leaf
Are those facing the sky
(With their axis nearby),
Which will suffer less bug-nibble grief.

To commote is to cause a commotion,
As remote is to foster remotion:
Demotions of note,
Thanks to popular vote,
From the words we all quote with devotion.

We raise cattle from India here
And administer shots every year.
When vaccines are 'bout due,
Then our local vet's crew
Knows to get the injectors in Gyr.

I vowed to my bride, "I'll endeavor
To cherish and love you forever
And a day, and I'll tend
To our union, no end,
Or at least till the twelfth day of never."

My grandma espouses donations
To a few "save the wombat" foundations.
But her fundraising trails
What's collected for whales;
Seems cetaceans rule public relations.

When I gorge myself silly on meat,
With cholesterol I am replete.
I eat bacon and wurst
Till I'm ready to burst.
Even then, I continue to eat!

You are guilty. You're sentenced, therefore,
To our gaol for life. What is more,
You'll be hanged, drawn and quart'ed;
To Queensland deported
(Which I think much too lenient crown law).

"Denaturalize me!" she bleated.
"More makeup, more implants!" she tweeted,
In hopes that enhancement
Would lead to entrancement
And murmurs of love oft repeated.

Take this liquid, and boil it. See, class,
How it all turns to vapor? The mass
Doesn't change, but the heat
Spreads the atoms out—neat!
So now (jumpin' Jack Flash) it's a gas!

"Our fave hen is now egg-bound, I fear.
An egg must be stuck in her rear.
Cracking eggs that are stuck,
Often works, with some luck".
"That's a cracking idea, I'd say, dear."

The mythical daughter of Leto
And twin of Apollo, she's neato.
This Artemis hunts.
She's a virgin (no stunts!)
So think twice before kissing her feet-o.

This rope loop of cotton supplies
The beholder a treat for his eyes:
To the circus we go
Where a high-flying show
With a cloud swing brings wonder and sighs.

On-site video there, though outmoded,
Was recording when Rover exploded.
It was your crud she swallowed,
Then the grisly stuff followed.
The tape's been cued up and it's loaded.

The weather is chilly and damp;
I run out of oil for the lamp;
My fire never ignites;
Every bug out there bites.
So just how can a drag show be camp?

In a sub shop outside Aberdeen,
On deployment with VP-19,
Elsie offered a grinder
Which made me remind her:
"I'm anti-, my dear, submarine."

A breakwater jutting from land
Gives the shoreline a chance to expand,
And a beach will be built
Of alluvial silt,
As the waves don't erode all the sand.

Here's the reason I shun estuation:
It fills me with great agitation.
If I watch a large pot,
Water never gets hot —
But then I boil instead, from frustration!

On the body that washed to the shore
The bite was a foot, maybe more.
That's the width of the mark
From the teeth of the shark
That swam round the deep ocean floor.

The possessions of lords or a king,
In old England or Scotland, would bring,
As a burgage, good rent
With the burghers' consent.
Pay in cash or in service—same thing!

For stupidity, Pat was unmatched.
Now he lies with a toe tag attached.
He stole drugs from the mob,
But they caught the poor slob.
Who needs courts? He was quickly dispatched.

English bulldogs make very good pets
Though their hips may need trips to the vets.
One, a formal tux wearer,
Brought a ring (served as bearer).
That's as strange and as weird as it gets.

First his guest-worker permit expired.
When his firm found that out, he was fired.
His intended then fled
From his flat and he said:
"That's enough, I'm fed up—sick and tired."

You could call a computer geek nerd-brain,
Or a comical wit, an absurd-brain;
But your raven and crow
Are so smart, don't you know—
Just say "thanks" when some clown calls you birdbrain.

An arrowworm floats in the sea,
In the plankton that's Neptune's debris.
One will see, if one looks,
That its head carries hooks
Used to capture its prey with esprit.

An agenda that's hidden?  No way!
I am flat out upfront when I say
That I want what I want,
Don't believe in detente,
And will crush all who stand in my way!

I like gamesmanship:  playing the man,
Not the ball or the puck. Here's my plan:
Hassle, hustle and niggle.
A poke and a dig'll
Provoke. Draw a foul? Yes I can!

A bull-bait (which Vaux called a "hank")
Was a blood sport where (let me be frank)
Poor bulls got tormented
By dogs: now prevented
By law.  (William Pulteney, we thank.)

He's the flavor du jour, the in thing.
Very likely, he'll soon not be king
Of the mountain.  His crowd,
Who is currently wowed,
Will move on.  He'll be yesterday's fling.

Though the car-buying gurus suggest
Many dozens of things you should test,
I'm a Coke-drinking man
And a cupholder fan:
If one's handy, forget all the rest.

Caducibranchiate? Here is the truth:
Though I'm getting quite long in the tooth,
I can still reminisce.
And what most do I miss?
It's the gills that I had in my youth.

No, I'm not the great lover of yore.
Where it matters I no longer score.
As I age I decline,
But I do not repine.
No hard feelings?  Well, not any more.

My athletics club ("Sports Club" it's called)
Has a stadium totally walled.
I do discus and shot;
50 yards I do not.
(I am seventy-two, and I'm bald.)

In new Cuba, Fidel would hold sway
With great help from a leftist named Che.
This agent insertable,
A Castro convertible,
Scared despot Batista away.

Abiology:  study of things
Not alive.  They don't walk or flap wings,
Don't perspire, don't eat,
Don't respire, excrete,
Or do anything else that life brings.

He was one who attempted to show
That his family was valid. Although
The poor Addon would fail,
We remember his tale
As a case of what fathers bestow.

You make pet cages, hutches and such;
I've a pet store. I'll put you in touch
With new owners in need
Of your products. Agreed?
And my finder's fee won't be too much.

On the trail, a man's horse is the source
Of friendship and even discourse.
My steed dislikes rant
So I never put Kant
Or Descartes ahead of the horse.

When saving a logo, I'll choose
To append .ai — I won't lose
Any quality when
I enlarge it times ten.
Now all I require is my muse.

Mighty Casey was looking quite miffed;
Two strikes — and he felt he'd been stiffed.
Then the pitcher stared in.
Casey knew he could win —
On the very next pitch, though, he whiffed.

Chlorophobia strikes when I've seen
Heads of lettuce or cars that are green.
This irrational fear
Makes my landscape austere.
Trees or forests? I've never been keen.

Your advances are getting much bolder;
Your touch is much harder and colder,
So that's why I wear
A big brass epauliere —
Armor plating protecting my shoulder.

I'm insane to a scary degree,
So the wildest of stunts fall to me.
For a prank that's supreme,
The famed painting The Scream
Will next month sport a small black goatee.

When Jehovah had something to say
To Mary, he sent down her way
Angel-messenger Gabe,
Who predicted a Babe—
But no holy roll in the hay.

When you crosspost your views on a forum
Then some of the members ignore 'em.
Some posters may shame you,
While others will flame you.
The critics will soon have a quorum.

In damp forests, you'll find devil's club.
It's a tall, leafy, spiny-stemmed shrub.
Branches dip when you trip —
Then spring back like a whip.
Watch your step.  They can give you a drub.

Gabriello Fallopio knew
Quite a lot of good stuff about you.
From Fallopian tubes,
On to eyes, ears and pubes,
This anatomist's prominence grew.

Motor racing's a battle of wits,
Needing courage and skill, although it's
Quite useless complaining
When black flagging's aiming
To signal you into the pits.

Although you may think that it's dumb,
This custom is practiced by some.
Whenever they're able,
They bypass the table
And recline when they eat.  They accumb.

You turn a deaf ear to my jeering
And my name-calling (clearly endearing).
But you'll listen, one fears,
If I call you cloth ears,
And deny you're at all hard of hearing.

A contemplative mood's where I find
Clearer insight and true peace of mind,
And in silent reflection
And calm introspection,
Direction to which I've been blind.

With the colonel, I'm just good and fed up!
His personnel file I should shred up.
Take the rank of this gent,
The first eighty percent,
And you'll see where this guy's got his head up!

Can God hear a word that he's sayin'?
The hushed, reverent mood he's portrayin'
Is calming — that's clear —
But it's so hard to hear
When our pastor, that church mouse, is prayin'.

Who's down in the hull?  There's a bosun,
A boatswain, a bos'n and bo'sun.
With each different name,
They're all one in the same;
Their relationship's surely a close 'un.

"With a bomb on your plane, was it scary?"
"Not at all, till it blew, and then very.
The pilot's advice
Was direct and concise:
'Clench your buttocks. It's gonna get hairy!'"

The young chicken, a hen, had red eyes.
And what's more, they were double the size
Of the rest in the brood.
A debate soon ensued
As to what caused this pullet surprise.

Roger Ebert reviewed the big screen
With a partner named Siskel, or Gene.
They achieved much renown
With their thumbs up or down,
Showing worth of the films that they'd seen.

On the stream bank the dark Alnus grew.
And beside 'twas a Taxus debut.
"You'll lose our light fight,"
Said the tree of great height,
"For I'll always be alder than yew."

Bernard Matthews bred turkeys in Norfolk;
All his products were fine, he'd assure folk.
But this avian flu tiff'll
Spoil what seemed "bootiful":
Mass-produced cruelty for poor folk?

Lady Nicola Constantine-Smith
Was betrothed to King Henry the Fifth,
But before they could wed,
The old boy was found dead...
(He was nearly as old as a myth).

I have vaginal blisters. I'm sure
This is genital herpes. No cure,
Which is awful enough,
But I caught this damn stuff
From my bridegroom. I'd thought he was pure.

A bouleversement is a tumble;
Something's turned upside down in a jumble;
Down is up; up is down.
But this noun makes me frown.
Can't pronounce it. Can't spell it. I fumble.

Bette Midler could never refute
That the Leibovitz picture was cute.
Now, in tribute, I'm nude,
Shouting, "Look at me, dude!"
My roses are blushingly mute.

A barefisted fight is the kind
Leaving knuckles and hands in a bind.
At the finish they're bruised,
Black-and-blue, and contused,
So the prizefighter's check can't be signed.

Galena, an Illinois city.
Galena, lead ore, very pretty.
A gray mineral, yes,
A.k.a. PbS.
Crystal safe, but dust toxic.  A pity.

When the drought broke, we danced in the rain,
So I hesitate now to complain,
But this 20-day storm
Is so far from the norm,
We now pray the floods cease, but in vain.

At the airport, the claim agent said,
"What color's your bag? Is it red?"
Rob replied with a frown,
"It's not red, it's dark brown.
Can you find it before time for bed?"

Take this pair, if you dare, and compare:
On the cross is (1). (2)'s on the square.
(1)'s what men'll 'n' women'll
Be if they're criminal.
(2) means they're upright and fair.

Empoverish means "to make poor";
You're an expert, my darling, for sure.
I was rich when we wed,
But I did as you said,
And put all on the red. Oh manure!

"Now be fair," said the young autoworker,
"It's not true that I'm simply a lurker.
I'm prepared to avow
I'm not building cars now,
But I'm checking that no-one's a shirker."

I said, "Doc, I need help, if you please,
As my emrods are down to my knees."
On his finger he smeared
A thick goo as he peered:
"Severe hemorrhoids! A painful disease."

No sylph, Mae was busty and beamy.
She spoke in tones sultry and steamy:
"In your pocket, ol' son,
Are y' hidin' a gun?
Or are y' jes happy t' see me?"

Play dominoes? Yes, here's a set,
But the rules, I'm afraid, I forget.
When I branched off your double
Last time, there was trouble;
I've not heard the end of it yet.

Critters walking on four feet are four-footed.
My cat Scat has six feet, so he's more footed
Than cats with no flaws.
Should poor Scat have sore paws,
My more sure-footed cat is more sore-footed.

At first called the Army Air Corps,
Now the Air Force is fighting the worps,
And I'd be a lot calmer
While flying this bomber
If ever I'd flown one beforps.

Imagine the plight of Paul Getty:
His guests all considered him petty,
For a payphone was all
They could use for a call,
With a coin box (just pass that machete).

To Dad's utter dismay I'm a cyber-
surfer googling for passes like Khyber,
Killiecrankie or Brander
With outspoken candour,
And sometimes for rivers like Tiber.

To a biker-bar brawl off Route 10
Came two brash but untested young men
Who engaged in the fray
In an educative way:
They learned not to do it again.

"Our great culture, of course, is superior;
Theirs, we insist, is inferior!"
From ethnocentricity,
War and duplicity
Follow, from motives ulterior.

The cinnabar moth's black-and-red
Is a warning to birds: eat the head
Or the body and wings
Of these elegant things—
Taste's so nasty, you'd wish you were dead.

Haciendas were used as plantations
To make cash off of mass subjugations
By the Empire of Spain.
Work was not quite humane
With long hours and small hopes for vacations.

There was a young lady from Kalisz
Who tended to, well, apple-polish.
She'd fawn and she'd flatter
With sycophant patter,
To find favor with men large and smallish.

"Can't control her," the captain declared.
He was good, but his skills were impaired
By a contrary wind,
So we kept our eyes skinned
For the shoals, monumentally scared.

Real essential (you bet!), an agenda
Lists the things that you gotta attend ta.
You can check one by one
To make sure they get done—
Or ignore 'em and go on a benda.

A couple, a duo, a pair,
A brace, and a dyad all share
A relation to two,
Just as doubletons do—
Also deuces and twains here and there.

You're bogged down in a mountain of work.
Can't complain, you'd come off as a jerk.
You've got data-compiling,
Archive-searching and filing.
It's a paycheck—few perks for a clerk.

My sewers are clogging in Plano,
And lava works better than Drano.
A steaming caldera
Might bring a new era.
I'd welcome a little volcano.

Thomas Cleaver's horse Sampson stood tall—
By all records the tallest of all.
Still under age two,
How his testicles grew!
Tom bawled, "Soon he won't fit in his stall!"

As a modern-day drug buccaneer,
I had entered my ship No Pot Here.
Now the cops suspect weed,
And I desperately need
To make 17 tons disappear.

Each year towards the end of November,
A calendar meant for December
Appeared on the  wall
Of my family's front hall—
It's something I'll always remember.

His old critters are far from divine.
My instinct, of course, says decline!
Let him ask other mates,
As reason dictates
This inheritance cannot be mine.

Aeroplankton abounds everywhere—
Living stuff that's suspended in air:
Mini plant-life and beasts
Such as spiders and yeasts—
Which is why we evolved nasal hair.

At the bid price, a broker is willing
To buy a security, filling
A need for those selling
Their stock and now smelling
A generous profit: a killing.

When the feedback's aversive, it's meant
As a punishment. There's no descent
  Into rancor or bile....
  Oh, you like it?  You smile?
That was certainly not my intent.

For able-bodied athletes who are
Doing sports that are strange and bizarre,
"Please be careful," said Mel.
"From a zip line I  fell;
Now I drive an accessible car."

Where he flops every night on his chair,
You will notice a flattening… there.
And the smell's less than sweet
Where he burdens the seat.
It's near leveled and begs for repair.

An arb is an arbitrageur,
Like a stock market entrepreneur:
Buy something up cheap
And then sell it off steep,
And a nice little profit secure.

Tiny blood platelets (thrombocytes) aid
In the forming of clots, rightly made
When you've cut yourself, but
If an artery's shut
By a clot, you might die, I'm afraid.

As I dig in your field, near the edge,
I'll be sure to preserve all the cledge
On your clay—fuller's earth.
Since I know what it's worth,
I'm extending my solemnest pledge.

For these four-footed mammals I'll hail,
The word buck is applied to the male:
Squirrel, rat, kangaroo,
Goat, and guinea pig, too.
But the elk? He's a bull, like the whale.

The complaint was not clatter but clutter
That caused my dear husband to mutter,
"Are these kids really mine?
All my instincts incline
Me to throw out their junk in the gutter."

Neighbour's dog woofs all night in the dark?
Well, some aspirin could well hit the mark.
It just might ease the pain
Of your poor throbbing brain —
There's a reason they make it from bark.

When, each morning, my workload deflates me,
Consuetudinary greeting awaits me:
Hot coffee, warm smile,
Routinely, with style.
But I'm sure every manager hates me.

In my pond I've a giant pet fish;
Arapaima grows more than you'd wish.
Now it's brought us both fame—
It and I weigh the same:
Equiponderate. Bring the big dish!

Fred's car was an Audi A6,
Equipped with four racing-type "slicks".
He drove far too fast,
So he soon breathed his last—
No more Route 66 tricks and kicks.

They give many fine hobbies a toss
For the one labeled "down" and "across".
Cruciverbalophiles
Greet each morning with smiles:
They'll be showing new crosswords who's boss.

A security checker named Dunn
Said, "These pat-downs are jolly good fun.
My libido is smokin'
While I'm gropin' and pokin' —
And I like that cute tat on your bun."

Congregationalist churches all choose
To be guided by membership views,
So they often will vote
On agenda of note,
Such as who gets to sit in their pews.

We have reached a delicious accord.
I can keep all I've managed to hoard.
When it comes to divorce
I don't ever endorse
Generosity one can't afford.

The term foot traffic might ring a bell,
But an image I'd like to dispel:
With this term we are talking
'Bout folks who are walking.
The ankles and up come as well.

Acceleration makes rates proceed faster,
As when trained in less time by a master
'Cause you're suitably bright,
Though when driving at night
It's a way of inviting disaster.

The lord's at their table, and eats
With the tenants, enjoying the treats.
This is coshery—tense,
Since who foots the expense?
The dependents who furnish the seats.

I've employed conjurations and potions
In my efforts to stir her emotions.
But she's not apathetic,
Just deeply ascetic.
Who am I to deny her devotions?

For a Chasid, a most pious Jew,
There are rules on just what he can do.
His observance of Law
Is precise, without flaw,
And there's more than just pork he'll eschew.

Will my thespian dream come about?
I don't know; I'm beginning to doubt.
Tell me, what now will cause it
To burst from the closet?
I guess I should just act it out.

Our dad often said he would pay
Out his fortune upon his last day,
To the one of us that
Father deemed the least fat,
Citing, "Where there's a will there's a weigh."

Stallone can no longer deny
That for years his career has been dry.
Some directors have said
He loves staying in bed
Very late, so his sleeping dogs Sly.

You've a mobile 'phone? What do you do
When a text of strange letters comes through?
FWIW:
These needn't trouble you.
For whatever it's worth, that's my view.

Our bonfires climb high and burn bright,
And their sparks, like the stars, light the night,
As the ashes of guys
Make their way to the skies.
England's Guy Fawkes Night's really a sight!

Aureola: an aura surrounding
The body of someone astounding.
When such visions appear
One is likely to hear
The voices of angels resounding.

My new book contains words of the kind
That my readers need clearly defined.
So my glossator friend
Has compiled, near its end,
All their meanings, thus easing my mind.

Proto-humans could switch ears' direction,
And the rims lacked today's circumflexion —
Were still flat, like a deer's.
Such Darwinian ears
Are a throwback (a slight imperfection).

Soon my uncle will cut back his trees
So that branches aren't all that he sees.
Exhibitionist Joan,
In her bedroom alone,
Is as naked and fine as you please.

As a kicker, Nick Rose is the best.
Now he faces his ultimate test,
But a field goal, no doubt,
Starting 80 yards out
Is a challenge. It's good? I'm impressed!

While carbon is handy for dating,
The answers add fuel to debating,
For skeptics make merry
When isotopes vary
For any cause other than waiting.

A bill to assist our fair city
Passed each house, but it's now a great pity:
The Senate won't budge,
And the House bears a grudge.
They have deadlocked the conference committee!

There once was a man from Del Mar
Whose license plate fell off his car.
His response, automatic,
Was antibureaucratic:
He repaired to the neighborhood bar.

How I love baby's tears, bright and green!
(What the hell does this lunatic mean?
Oh, the Corsican curse
Is the star of this verse,
The most beautiful nettle I've seen.)

Could there be some advantage or merit
In a bricktop of hair like a carrot?
A Neanderthal's mop
Might be reddish on top,
But it's one thing we didn't inherit.

When I beckoned, and ordered a flummery,
The waiter looked sad and said, "Bummer." He
Explained that the flan
Had been flushed down the can,
And they'd called for emergency plumbery.

Standup comic Jack Carter's not witty
But can act and can belt out a ditty.
Many talents he's got;
One thing more, though, he's not:
Indonesia's great capital city.

"Second element," just as she lands,
"Is a choctaw," the watcher demands.
"Change your edges," he barks,
"Leaving perfect, tight arcs."
If he's hard, his trainee understands.

I am sure I will never forget
When I first got to use a curette.
While removing the tumor,
I tried to use humor,
And bombed, to my lasting regret.

Aphra Behn built a life round the word
At a time when most women weren't heard.
Back when bees ruled the page,
And swarmed loud on the stage,
Spy Astræa — a solit'ry bird!

You're devoted to life as a clerk,
Where your Internet line is a perk.
You'll begin every morn
Busy surfing for porn,
But you'll dedicate lunchtime to work.

"My good friend, I am begging, you will
Please to stay until having your fill
Of chaat, spice to suit.
I've aloo, or some fruit,
And of course, there will not be a bill."

To demobilize, troops must disband.
No more milit'ry action is planned.
We have orders—no jive—it
Means every last private
And sarge and lieutenant is canned.

Once you've found perfect joy in her kiss,
Take her home to meet Momma and Sis.
Married bliss you'll enjoy.
If she bears you a boy,
Please invite me (don't miss!) to the bris.

The coracoid: bony projection
From the scapula, in the direction
Of the sternum. From Greek
For "a ravenlike beak,"
It's a locus for biceps connection.

Dripping wet at the pool stood sweet Jeanie.
Zeke assessed her physique and bikini:
"I don't mean to impose—
Wanna shed those soaked clothes
And slip into a tall dry martini?"

As a host, I am no rank beginner,
So each guest at our table's a winner.
Some think finicking chic,
But all you do's critique,
And no doryphore joins us for dinner.

Fully-fashioned these stockings, I see
How they're shaped to your thigh and your knee —
How they cling to your bum.
There's no slacking, dear mum.
Now, what are you cooking for tea?

Squash, meringue, pickles, sushi, red meat,
Ice cream, truffles — these foods I can eat
After gorging on roast,
Deep-fried sausage, French toast...
See, my stomach is made of concrete.

She sucks up to the boss, see her fall
All over him — how she's the gall ...!
She cajoles, brings him tea,
Almost screams, "Look at me —
See, I'll just lick your boots while I crawl."

To protect your best horse, use a bard—
Not a poet, but armor that's hard.
It deflects weapon blows;
It's adornment that shows.
You'll be voguish and won't be off-guard!

The Acoemetae (Byzantine brothers)
Prayed ceaselessly, unlike the others.
Known as "those without rest,"
They were somewhat obsessed.
I'd be snoozing, if given my druthers.

His stern, straitlaced wife is a paragon—
A modern-day Catherine of Aragon—
But his foremost complaint's
All the paintings of saints
That she hangs. ("Where's my pinup of Farrah gone?")

My dreamworld appears as I sleep.
I can get there by counting up sheep.
But sometimes its features
Include fearsome creatures
I hide from when terror runs deep.

Our battle's about to begin;
With chanting and pickets we'll win!
We'll cry, "Out with the old!
Give us bread without mold!"
We shall demonstrate 'til they give in.

In colloids, a chemist must cope
With particles small beyond hope.
But the amicrons' scale
Is so tiny that they'll
Be the smallest bits seen with a 'scope.

My chemist friend, Danny McGuire,
From comedy needs to retire.
One day in the lab
I said, "Call me a cab."
He replied, "You're an auto for hire."

We respected our new civic leader,
An intelligent chap, quite a reader.
Our esteem soon was tested
When we saw him arrested—
An unlicensed driver, a speeder!

If it's aphyllopodic, you care:
Lower stems lacking leaves; almost bare.
Checking further details
Of this sedge: are there scales?
On inspection—indeed, they are there!

The digestion of British roast beef
After chewing's achieved in the chief
Through the stomach, where juices
Have break-it-down uses.
(No good for what's stuck in your teef!)

Why, you con-artist phony (political)!
You fudged your analysis (critical).
Your slick greedy ways'll
Corrupt your appraisal,
You son of a bitch (parasitical)!

The term babyware, everyone knows,
Means the stuff baby needs as he grows,
But if it is penned
E-A-R at the end,
Then it's clear you're just speaking of clothes.

A defeat device has been installed,
So these Volkswagen cars are recalled.
This dishonest attempt
To make their cars exempt
From the smog rules means I am appalled.

Through the air, reckless daredevils flew,
Slickly doing each trick that they knew.
So we gave them applause
For daredeviltry, 'cause
One should give daring devils their due.

It's oft euphemistically said,
"He's an angel," but don't be misled.
Please don't think me unkind,
But let's all keep in mind:
That's a soldier, once living, now dead.

My full house clearly beats your ace high.
Hope you've got on some underwear, guy.
"Stop crowing, Fernando.
I'm going commando,"
Was Tom's quite expansive reply.

Scoliosis turns spines into S's.
One cure uses pressure and stresses.
Abbott's method requires
Long tight straps, pads and wires
Under shirts, blouses, sweaters and dresses.

I cherished my pet axolotl;
I found him, one day, in a bottle.
I tugged on his tail...
"Oh no!" did I wail:
"I've rendered my lizard acaudal!"

In the football he kicked, Tom had put
Some saltpetre, some sulphur, and soot,
To make a small bomb…
Like this verse, poor old Tom
Is now missing a foot.

There's a custom I share with my folks.
Every year we play practical jokes.
On the first day of May
I am careful to stay
Out of range of a letter that smokes.

Tom attends all the basketball dances,
And to six-foot-tall girls makes advances.
There's a problem, though, see?
The guy stands four foot three,
So his height does not favor his chances.

Alisphenoid? Of course it is dull!
Well, it took a few hours to mull
Over how to harass
My anatomy class.
I said, "Draw all the bones in the skull."

Life is loaded with burdensome rules,
Like the stuff we are taught in our schools.
I prefer to be free,
Both to do and to be—
A burdensome prospect for fools!

Now this is the point amphidromic:
So (except on a level atomic)
The tides do not flow
Around here. Now you know.
(You expected this verse to be comic?)

"His review of my dance made me burn!"
Said the Soviet dancer named Fern.
"To his comrades, I'll bet,
He panned my pirouette,
And he called it a cheap common turn."

At a barbecue, not eating meat?
Then a beanburger's what you can eat:
Veg and beans, which you make
In the shape of a cake.
It's a healthy and flavoursome treat!

Many kids these days don't know their dad
And are raised by their mum — good or bad.
Children want, more than toys,
Father figures. All boys
Need such role-models — every last lad.

With the pitiless gaze of a hawk,
In a pit, archaeologists stalk.
For the bits of the mole,
Stratigraphic control
Is the role of the sides of the baulk.

Crashing through Collyer mansion conditions,
Amid all sorts of noxious emissions,
The firefighters grumbled,
Searched blindly and stumbled
On tons of long-saved acquisitions.

The process of colorization
By computer soon brought on elation.
And with black-and-white prints
Thus enhanced, I'm convinced
Classic films create new conversation.

Goliath the giant was hot.
In battle he knew what was what
Till a boy, on his own,
With a sling and a stone
Dispatched him with only one shot.

Glenda's gang can't be stylish in school,
But, once out, fashionistas must rule.
As long legs sashay by,
Drivers brake with a sigh;
Tight and high signals uniform cool.

The brisket's the breast of a cow
(Once it's butchered as beef, anyhow).
It's the part that you corn
So it's sorta reborn
As corned beef and cabbage. Eat now!

An exponent? That's Tom, we're agreed.
Every word that he writes, you should read.
He's a role model, clear,
He's the best in his sphere.
He's just marvellous. Follow his lead!

I would call him a flea-bitten cur,
Or an imbecile if you'd prefer.
I would call him a fool
Or a dolt, as a rule.
(To his face, of course, mostly it's "Sir.")

Those Dactyloscopidae fish
Won't likely wind up on my dish.
They hide in the sand
Of their wet grazing land.
To feast on them isn't my wish.

There once was a Doric stonecutta
Whose adornments sent ladies aflutta.
He said, "I can't trust 'em
To fondle my frustum."
(Get your mind, baby, out of the gutta.)

Mesolithic once-called, it's a part
Of the Stone Age's ventures in art:
Between Old Stone and New
(Bronze Age not yet in view).
The who-cares level's way off the chart.

There's a magic abroad in the air:
An expectancy children all share
Which leads up to a scene—
"Come down quick! Yes, he's been!"
Christmas morning—I know—I was there.

Work each limb? Just get slim? Flirt with Kim
On a whim? Keep your body in trim?
Get more muscly? Less weak?
Reach your physical peak?
Run, lift, press, row, pull, sweat — at our gym!

In Macbeth, dagger drawn, a great actor
Heard the voice of a vicious detracter.
"This is absolute balls!"
She opined from the stalls
(In her death, a significant factor).

My bonnie lies over the ocean—
The spur to the following notion:
I'll buy a canoe,
Take some sandwiches too.
Let my paddling confirm my devotion.

My fishnet I use to catch trout.
It helps scoop them, so why do I pout?
Fish don't bite at these sites
When I wear fishnet tights;
Guess my sexy attire freaks them out.

This winter, for more than a week, a
Vacation I'll probably seek—a
Good climate, white beaches,
And high mountain reaches.
I'll find them in sweet Costa Rica.

Doc's words did not leave Lesley chuffed:
"Your errhine meds need to be snuffed."
So, said Les, "If you please—
I just hate when I sneeze."
"It's the best way to get you unstuffed."

Given credit notes, people believe
In the cash that they hope to receive
For the goods that you bought;
Otherwise, they are fraught
By the thought that you're out to deceive.

"Am I good at my craft? I'd say very!
With my eyes closed," bragged head baker Barry,
I could bake you a cake
That would make your mouth ache,
Although driving to work might be hairy."

The courtliest lawyer in court
Had a mannerly mien of the sort
That he'd manage to cash in,
In elegant fashion,
While nailing your ass for a tort.

If "nutcase" you'd like to convey
In a silent, circuitous way,
Try the cuckoo sign, dear:
Twirl your forefinger near
To your temple — a "screw loose" display.

When you're making fruit salad, you'll frown
If your nicely sliced apples turn brown.
The trick is you oughta
Acidulate water
And dunk them so browning slows down.

"See this goods train (or freight train) pass through?
It carries no passengers. Who
Would ride in a coal truck?
Or telegraph pole truck?"
"No, freight isn't human, that's true!"

When I suffered a ruptured aorta,
I was given the blood of my daughter.
The bleeding (abdominal)
Was truly phenomenal;
Thank heaven blood's thicker than water.

He's a dummkopf, a blockhead, a moax,
The type about whom we make jokes.
He is so much a dope
That we haven't much hope
He'll fit in with us capable folks.

It enfolds like invisible mist
Around people who find they exist
With joint empathy bared
Through experience shared.
Fellow feeling: the sense will persist.

The carter turned into my drive.
I was happy to see him arrive!
He delivered the thing
That I'd ordered last spring—
A new cart so my business could thrive!

First articu, then lary help make
Up a term to convey your bad break
When you tripped on that fella
And broke your patella—
That's bona fide pain you can't shake.

Carcinomas we seek to control
May need hormones, which furthers our goal.
To inhibit aromatase
In a breast carcinoma case
Is the whole of anastrozole's role.

Clinton says, "He's all hat and no cattle.
He is just selling hope in this battle."
But, out on the range,
The people want change,
And louder and louder their rattle.

My brusquely said comebacks  reflect
All the times my big mouth got me decked.
Now I choose words with care
And hope time will repair
My poor face, which has often been wrecked.

First at school, then at work, now as mum:
My defailance all round makes me glum.
Not a single success —
I'm a failure, no less;
Though I try all I can, I'm just dumb.

"We boarded a boat and we fled
From oppression", the boat people said.
Though their chances weren't good,
It was well understood:
They would rather be dead than be red.

Upper management types, we've aspired
To be classy when somebody's fired.
He's too young to retire?
Well, it's rather less dire
To tell Myron he's being dehired.

Once abundant, the threatened cahow
Is a bird rarely heard, even now.
Still this petrel survives
In Bermuda and strives
To revive, if conditions allow.

I could synthesize lipids all day,
But that acetyl coenzyme A
Is a substance I lack.
Now Krebs' cycle's off track:
Mitochondria in disarray.

I'm between jobs, I'm sorry to say
("Unemployed," that is meant to convey),
Though I'd make an exultant
Financial consultant
At two thousand dollars a day.

What befell that poor fellow, the skel?
What bechanced him? He fell down a well.
If not rescued betimes,
He might pay for his crimes,
As he'll find what betides him in Hell.

Being tenderly young or quite old;
Letting wind, rain or sleet take a hold:
In our lives, these detractors
Are contributory factors
In catching a cough or a cold.

To bad-talk a person implies
That he's someone you scorn or despise.
Are the brickbats you hurl
'Cause he's stolen the girl
You adore out from under your eyes?

When a jungle is asphalt, it's home
Not to lions and tigers who roam
Through savannas and woods,
But to gangs in the 'hoods,
Be it Philly, Chicago, or Nome.

Now that fat cat is happily chuff,
Having power and money and stuff,
But his corpulent feline,
Who's making a beeline
For sustenance, can't get enough.

Cinnamomum, or cassias, are trees,
Grown in lands where they also grow teas.
They're a chemical source:
Camphor, spices of course.
So, your cinnamon rolls? They're Chinese.

Old Noah had stowed in his ark
An animal built in the dark.
Asked how long did it take
This weird creature to make,
Gott replied, "Days und days of aardvark."

Ahead looms an ominous date
With beckoning Fate at the gate
Of heaven or hell —
I really can't tell,
But destiny scorns all debate.

Our veterinarian Jay
Says alsike-type clover in hay
For a horse or a cow
Must be dried in a mow:
If it never grows mold it's okay.

If, when farming, you just have a baule
Of a nutrient,  crop growth will stall
At one-half.  You might guess
You need two (more or less);
The yield boosts to three-quarters, that's all.

I've committed a terrible sin,
So to deal with my shame and chagrin,
A burnt offering will
Make God happy, but still
Let the priests keep the animal's skin.

"Oh, look, there's a lady out sailing.
Oh dear, she appears to be bailing.
Ah, there's no need to fuss—
See? She's waving at us!"
(But in truth, she was drowning and flailing).

Jack Horner became quite obese
Eating holiday pies without cease,
So he's now on a diet.
When someone serves pie, it
Is fine—he just tries a small piece.

Abstemious abstention? That's good!
Drunk debauchery? Bad for the blood!
So the moral brigade
Will lead their crusade,
Choosing life by the drip not the flood.

Bruce Banner was blasted by rays,
So now when his anger's ablaze,
He increases in bulk,
Turning into the Hulk—
A green monster whom nothing can faze.

The young cassowary lass was named Ginny.
She was painfully shy and quite skinny,
But she flourished and grew,
Till Ms. Emu said, "You
Now can boast you're the toast of New Guinea!"

A thing that's designed to be used
With a second keeps people amused.
When my software gets old,
I buy add-ins—behold!
I'm enthused where before I just snoozed.

The prime message she left on our phone
Was to say she would play her trombone.
Her digressional words
Ranged from cooking to birds —
So off-topic — a world of her own!

No more wagers in poolrooms. I'm through.
Here's  a shark who knew just what to do.
I am facing a shot
Which he knows I ain't got.
I'll kill time just by chalking my cue.

My finch looked exceedingly fat
As it sat on a mat in my flat,
And this small yellow bird
Flashed a smile most absurd—
The canary had eaten the cat.

Jack looked blue.  I asked, "Why the long face?"
"Am I that dolichofacial, Ms. Grace?"
"Jack, that joke is so bad —
Like your lawyering — sad!
Guess you lost one more cut-and-dried case."

Goalball's played by two teams made of three
Para-athletes unable to see.
The game's ball contains bells,
So restrain all your yells —
To be able to hear it is key.

My sweet wife's had a lifelong affair
With old Wedgwood — their cameo ware.
It's the graceful motif
In two-color relief
She adores. She's got thousands, I swear.

The dateline ID's where one's been
When reporting the copy sent in.
Mr. Doyle, just today,
Sent from Sydney, Green Bay,
Yokohama, La Paz and Berlin!

After twenty-plus years of relation,
Civil partnership prompts a libation.
We've got fallen arches
From all those Pride marches:
We've earned this conventionalization.

Chiropractic ascription's a flair,
 With talent to pinpoint what's there
 Causing twitching or pain,
 And then to explain
 How adjustments repair the affair.

I am Igor, Doc Frankenstein's aide,
Often shouted at, kicked, poorly paid.
But fringe benefits, see,
Mean my dentures were free,
And my wife was as well, and well made.

Epicurus, oft misunderstood,
Named pleasure a man's highest good,
But was quick to explain
He meant peace, without pain,
Not to get a nice piece when you could.

Grain and sacrificed animals (male)
Used for offerings, blessings prevail,
And the glory of God
Shone before them abroad:
They fell frontwards, soon prostrate (and pale).

My wife holds a socialist view,
A collectivist; honest, it's true.
My lawyer concurs
All I owned is now hers,
Since our union's officially through.

Prof. Windy's just slightly bombastic
When ranting on matters scholastic—
His students conjecture
They rebuilt his lecture
Hall's walls to be aeroelastic.

Our bodies have cyclical features;
I learned this in school from my teachers.
Biorhythms dictate
When we eat, when we mate—
Are we purely mechanical creatures?

We all laugh at the man of Darjeeling,
And the use that he made of the ceiling;
But the fellow who sat
Just beneath where he spat
Expressed a more negative feeling.

Zippy hawkmoths grip ladies with claspers,
But these gizmos aren't just sexy graspers.
If a moth hears a bat,
Bingo! Quicker than scat,
He jams sonar with ultrasound raspers.

Pastor Jude, an excluder, a priss,
Told a gay that the Bible says this:
"Same-sex ties ye can't bind;
There are some left behind."
"My firm ass," said the gay, "ye may kiss."

Drudge work chafes, so the minutes drag by;
That's a maxim that none can deny.
But for moments of leisure,
Engaging in pleasure,
Amazingly, watch the time fly.

At a shop at the town galleria,
Hairy pottery's covered with chia.
That's related to mint,
But I'll give you a hint:
It's a simply bizarro idea!

Most everyone knows you don't dare a bull.
In a similar vein, it's a terrible
Resolve you incite
If you're picking a fight
With one dormant whose might is unbearable.

Bound for Rio, we cross the equator
On our rust-bucket Malta-flagged freighter.
Though her hull's less than fit
And she's listing a bit,
Still, we'll clear the holds sooner or later.

The hold-up was in its homestretch.
The stage's gold bars we would fetch.
"Throw the cashbox down, Clyde!"
And then right 'fore I died,
The last thing that I heard was, "Nice catch!"

The automatist's very emphatic
That our actions are all automatic.
But if he's correct
About cause-and-effect,
Then why's our behavior erratic?

The condition called verbal apraxia
Is terrible when it attacks ya.
It leaves you aghast
WhhnNNN hha jnnghhhh ... blast!
Tjruqk buhHH nghh gGGGG wuhwuh wUH!

The Baltic States: one is Estonia,
Which, with Latvia, took in Livonia.
Lithuania's next,
Making three — all quite vexed
When the USSR said,  "We own ya."

The cardinal flower is red.
It's a showy-lipped plant that has spread
From Miami to Maine.
Its familiar terrain
Is a swamp, not your gardening bed.

Lord Netherbourne liked to emblaze
His regalia in one of two ways,
Either sequins and gems,
From the necklines to hems,
Or his motto (in mink) "Breeding Pays".

"It's a wonder we still are alive.
Slowing down sure would help us arrive
Safely home," she critiqued.
Then I screamed, anger peaked,
"Either shut the hell up or you drive!"

Acholeplasma are microbes whose class,
Mollicutes, recalls a young lass,
Molly Wallace, a cutie
In high school whose booty
Turned all the boys' heads when she'd pass.

I asked a tough question of Kurt.
I was shy and demure—not a flirt.
He responded quite curtly—
Though clearly expertly—
His reply so abrupt that it hurt.
 
So I said, "Kurt, your  curtness was quite
Inappropriate, rude, impolite!"
"Well, for better or worse,"
He replied, "I am terse."
And he turned on his heel and took flight.

An ambition of mine's to design
A routine to extract all the wine
Of life from each day,
No matter how grey;
But if sometimes I falter, that's fine.

Perfect workmanship rarely is found;
When it's found on a coin, small and round,
Some folks with cognition
Might say "erudition"—
This meaning, though rare, is quite sound.

Aunt Jemima, Aunt Sally, Aunt Jane
Are all negative terms, in the main.
Plus Aunt Mary will do,
Thomasina (Aunt, too),
For black women we highly disdain.

When Elmer shot wabbits, what muddlement
Befell him! His fall in a puddle meant
A rush of confusion.
A nasty contusion
Intensified Elmer's befuddlement.

Paper books are no longer iconic,
As our publishing's now electronic.
Read my poems on line.
You will find them divine—
Still sardonic, abstruse, and ironic.

Euxanthin — my teacher once bade
Me research: Was bright pigment once made
From the urine of cattle
Fed mango leaves? "That'll
Make Indian yellow. Won't fade."

"He's bad news, that tough guy in black leather.
It pains me to know you're together.
He'll make trouble for you,
And he's dangerous too."
"Mom, not likely.  He's wearing a tether."

The cost of this war is in billions;
We're killing Iraqi civilians.
Lots of blood has been spilled,
Countless innocents killed:
Bush's cronies are counting their millions.

A concordance allows you to find
Many words (which may come to your mind)
Used by Shakespeare or Burke.
"To produce one is work."
So says Kevin [i.e., undersigned].

He moved north from Jamaica, I know,
And his taro, at first, wouldn't grow,
But this winter we spied,
In his garden, outside,
That he'd raised them—dasheen through the snow!

Do you want to read texts in Bengali?
Then the poet Tagore is your pal. He
Used words that they utter
On the streets of Calcutta.
With that daughter of Sanskrit you'll dally.

The Castaways had their entire
Hit output with this: "Liar, Liar."
Nothing else came as close.
Though they said adios
To success, they were briefly on fire.

Today on my walk, what I saw
Was a man with a flaw in his maw:
His jawbone grew wrong,
So his chin was too long.
This disfigurement's called Habsburg jaw.

This chocolate bar is delicious,
And eating it now seems propitious!
Though it isn't quite fair,
I had better beware
'Cause this candy bar isn't nutritious!

"Major Tom, as your ground control, we
Maintain contact continuously.
All your readouts are go."
"Roger—time for my show.
EVA! Float peculiarly."

When I'm typing, for instance, these rhymes,
I use bold and italic as mimes.
They are faces I pull;
Oh, my cases are full
Of fresh slants to enliven dull Times.

"There once was a PERSON called NAME
Whose LEWD QUALITY won some acclaim"
(This form is archaic,
And quite formulaic,
But funny enough all the same).

For antiphony choirs must split
And find two separate places to sit.
Sung from left and from right,
Music's sure to delight.
The conductor, though, may have a fit.

Though my father might glower or glare,
It is not in his nature to swear.
Damn and blast or hells' bells
Are the worst words he yells,
And to utter such oaths is so rare.

A bizarre-acting maid from Slovenia
Said, "I fear... that I have... neurasthenia!"
Watch her play with my keys.
It is obvious she's
Got disorganized type schizophrenia.

Once, with diamonds her crown was begemmed;
With rubies, her gowns were all hemmed.
But the king's heart has hardened:
Though she's begged to be pardoned,
The axe will come down. She's condemned.

An animal act at the fair
Featured bears that were covered with hair.
When performing their dance,
They wore tutus and pants,
So I asked, "Can't you bear a bear bare?"

When you take mathematics in school,
You are taught the distributive rule.
If you "times" by a sum,
The result will become
Just the sum of the products. That's cool!

At the bar she purred, "You're so attractive.
I hope you don't mind;  I'm proactive."
"Not at all," he replied.
"As for kids, I'll confide
That my sperm are all radioactive."

My girlfriend got pregnant — no good.
Daddy's angry? That's well understood.
The creep had me beat
And then turned up the heat —
We got pastorized quick as we could.

Are your discourses tired and bland?
Do you want to sound pompous and grand?
Drop compendiate in
("To collect") and begin
Using words that folks don't understand.

It isn't a quick, casual look;
More the kind when you're lost in a book.
Like a babe at its mother,
We gaze at each other —
And simmer if looks were to cook.

Court statements must be categorical.
Don't confuse with descriptions rhetorical,
Or generalise;
In fact you'd be wise
To avoid what appears allegorical.

Galápagos green turtles abound
In the oceans, not only around
Those islands we call
The Galápagos. In all
The Pacific warm waters they're found.

I was wooing this gal for a while
And her face opened up in a smile.
Then she started to laugh
Like a startled giraffe.
I think she's as cracked as her dial.

Gabby ordered a plate of grillade:
Sizzling sausages drizzled in lard,
And sweet-syrup-sozzled
Back bacon bits, crozzled
And blackened and crispy and charred.

When the criminals formed a consortion,
Planning crimes of enormous proportion,
They eschewed petty theft
For felonious heft—
Prostitution, narcotics, extortion.

From the Senate of Rome's secretariat,
The old consul arrived in a chariot.
Distribution of rations
Was one of his passions—
He inspected the troops' commissariat.

The chocolate hostage, room 10,
Hasn't pooped since we don't know just when.
If strong laxatives can't
Bring relief more than scant,
We'll be bobbing for apples again.

A bull's-eye's a lantern, my friends,
With, on one side, a very thick lens
That will concentrate light.
Now, for meanings tonight,
This is not where the list of them ends.

Every seam is encased, pressed, and creased
On her summer dress, sheer pink batiste.
Designed for a goddess,
Its prim pin-tucked bodice
Tops ten tiers of skirting, at least.

The Tobacco Mosaic, it's seen,
Is a virus especially mean.

All-day singings are held in our small
Rural church, courtroom, schoolhouse, or hall.
Singing hymns, we rejoice
(In four sections by voice):
Each, in turn, leads the group.  What a ball!

I was pinned to the spot—couldn't flee;
But the swearing helped set my mind free,
With a "Damn you!" I cursed
At the one who'd reversed
Without looking, straight into my knee.

That magnet's designed to attract,
But he's not just attractive, in fact,
Since he equally well
Can repulse and repel
If he's lacking in charm and in tact.

The bookmaker's only regrets,
As he tallies his customers' bets,
Are concerning the bite
He insists isn't right—
That's the cut that the government gets.

Seems today's their thirteenth anniversary.
The husband wants kids in the nursery,
But the wife's on the pill,
So they're arguing still.
Their discussion's all kinds of discursory.

You wanna do what with me?  Eek!
Your perversion has reached a new peak.
I regretted before;
Now you show even more?
You're as weird as all get out, you freak!

Accentor, for me, is a word
Whose meaning is odd and absurd.
It does not, as I guessed,
Show the syllable stressed;
It's merely a sparrow-like bird.

One eventide (evening), full moon,
In the year '69, end of June,
My girl friend just kissed me
Good-bye and dismissed me,
"I won't be the wife of a  loon."

This liberal thinker was blinded
By her beauty but oh, what her whine did:
"Buy me shoes, a new dress—
My whole wardrobe's a mess!"
So I split. She was just too clothes minded.

Prion proteins can cause this neuropathy.
(Farmers, losing their herds for no proper fee,
Hid this "mad cow disease".)
Written out, BSE's
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

When White Castle showed off it's great power
With a slogan that made business flower,
A competitor, mad,
Used a copycat ad.
It's that burger chain known as White Tower.

To an auction, a novice did go
To win treasures for trivial dough.
To his shock and surprise,
'Cause he rubbed itching eyes,
He heard, "Sold! Thank you, Sir.  Such a pro!"

The grass on my lawn isn't green,
And my neighbors all think it's obscene.
With no rain after May,
It turns brown just like hay,
And I leave it that way to be mean.

When the general assembly will meet,
Those beneath it will find themselves beat.
Nor archbishop, nor sheriff,
Nor major, nor seraph —
There's none that can take off the heat.

It was Jennifer M. Capriati
Who astounded the sports literati.
This tennis persona
Took gold (Barcelona),
But since then her play has been spotty.

An amoeba's a wonderful pet,
And as maintenance-free as they get.
No need to be tutored,
It's already neutered;
Not a single cell call to the vet.

I'm hating this coffee I got;
Gourmet it distinctly is not.
From its flavor I'd flee
But I hope it will be
Analeptic, 'cause that hits the spot!

My vision is sharp as an eagle.
My bearing is anthropoid, regal.
So you might be surprised
That my tail's not disguised.
I've been animalized. I'm Meg Beagle!

With a dog you know where you are at.
But you can't say the same for a cat.
It will sit there and stare,
Maybe cough up some hair,
Or deposit dead mice on your mat.

My friend cooked a juicy ham slice
With some hot aromatic  brown rice.
It smelled so divine
As we started to dine
That I knew I would fill my plate twice!

A cabbage is known as a head,
But a wise word no cabbage has said.
The green leaves I tend
Are the banknotes I spend.
Trusty cabbage is my daily bread.

When a woman is asked to betroth,
She might fly at her flame like a moth,
Or if shy and demure,
Veil her face and stay pure
By availing herself of a cloth.

This evil alliance began
With Germany's Aryan plan.
Fascist Italy joined
And "the Axis" was coined.
Added last? Hirohito's Japan.

An upholstery artisan, Glover,
Awakens as coworkers hover.
After falling, unseen,
In a fabric machine,
He's recovered, but might not recover.

The pads of your fingers are bloody.
The edema bars harpsichord study.
Seems your hands are a mess!
I proclaim (more or less)
That it's Achenbach Syndrome, old buddy!

There are little- and big-type brown bats,
And they both eat mosquitoes, moths, gnats,
Mayflies, beetles and midges.
They'll roost under bridges,
But attics are perfect bat flats.

Dear Fern,
You're enchanting, I hear,
To those ruminant nibblers, the deer.
Your evergreen fronds
Will, like magical wands,
Make incredible cravings appear.

Count P. Stroganov's name was as shown,
But the entrée he made is well known
As beef Stroganoff, and
So we all understand,
Space for recipe here is now blown.

Said the pie to the cake, being cruel,
"Get a load of that idiot! You'll
Think he's simple, I deem—
He's just fruit and whipped cream!"
Scoffed the cake, "I agree! What a fool!"

A shark has a large dorsal fin.
When we see one approach, we begin
To head quickly for shore,
Yelling, "Shark! Shark!" and more,
So that swimmers are warned by the din.

Yes, your 4x4's service is due
And a courtesy car's booked for you.
It'll bounce through the trees,
One-in-ones climb with ease…
Kids to school? It should handle that too.

Despicable Ness is so crude;
She's so morally loathsome and rude,
That's she's more shunned of late
Than that lewd Fawny Kate,
Or even that bad Hattie Jude.

"Now eutaxy prevails; all's in order,"
Wrote the scribe (the king's history recorder).
"Every law is obeyed;
Fees and taxes are paid.
No fake passports are seized at the border."

Shut your cakehole, Madame Antoinette!
That big mouth of yours! Lest you forget:
They lack bread! They don't wash!
Where will they find brioche?
I thank God there's no guillotine yet!

Tiny edits set Phillie Phelps keening,
"You have altered my sentence's meaning
With that changed preposition
And comma omission.
Now it's ruined—such crass intervening!"

I enjoy a downhill on the skis,
But it gives me sore ankles and knees.
With diclofenac rub,
Though, I'm back in the club
And off sliding with relative ease.

Daddy longlegs the harvestman tilts
On eight skinny and segmented stilts.
Unlike spidery guys
He's got one pair of eyes
And a penis deployed to the hilts.

It's not hard to commute in D.C. —
A free ride when you're with the VP.
But steer funds to the Hill
And you're jammed there until
You agree to say, "Please pardon me."

Jill the typesetter shared common ground
With her friend, but on one point she frowned:
That despite the amount her
Chef friend liked a counter,
He thought bowls belonged on it, not 'round.

From a bridgehead we made on the beach,
All our soldiers rushed into the breach,
But too many were felled
As the enemy held,
So our grasp was well short of our reach.

Cough and Wheeze, at a hundred to one,
Is a racehorse unwilling to run.
The same odds for Last Inning
Means their chances of winning
Are even, I'd say (almost none).

Araucana — these chickens I've seen
On the Southern American scene.
The hens (and the males)
All have heads but no tails,
And their eggs are a pale shade of green.

His experimentation's controlled,
But alchemically clever and bold.
Taking tungsten and lead,
He's been forging ahead
Turning commonplace metals to gold.

His objective with Beatrice was breeding.
Neath her beading, he thought about seeding.
Would she let him proceed?
Did she, too, want to breed?
On his forehead the sweat began beading.

I was begging my lead-footed niece,
"This ridiculous speeding must cease!
As your passenger, I'm
Not that worried 'bout time.
Please just get me there all in one piece!"

Cloudy dimness—oh, what caligation!
My vision is poor! Such frustration!
I'm longing to read,
So I guess what I need
Are some glasses, or else medication.

The aeolian scale we can play
On the white keys from A up to A.
Scales modal are finer
Than others, like minor.
Include a raised seventh? No way!

"Look, sailor, ya think I was beatin'
Fer nothin'? Ya missed the repeatin.'"
"Da capo, it said,
So I went to the head."
"That's the start of the music, you cretin!"

Minnie Phelps, the poor thing, is ablaze
With an urgent hormonal malaise
Of concupiscence (lust).
She's 14 (only just),
And Ramón hasn't phoned her for days!

There are many renowned for their kenning,
Their wisdom, wit, judgment and penning;
But the first among peers
For one hundred (Yes!) years,
Beyond reasonable doubt, was Lord Denning.

Indigestion beset a young lass,
Who in agony rolled on the grass.
Her discomfort was brief,
When at last her relief
Was obtained by the passing of gas.

Poe created a word that few know
That relates to a frog pond. How so?
As a word experimentalist,
He shunned transcendentalist:
"Frogpondian's more apropos!"

They arranged their first rendezvous at
A chateau that was called Montserrat.
She was dressed all in puce,
With her hair hanging loose,
And he cried, "Where's your red flowered hat?"

I had called up Nanette with aplomb
With just one goal in mind: drop the bomb.
I broke faith with my date
At an hour quite late:
I would not be attending her prom.

To find secrets the genome possessed,
The geneticists often finessed,
Forcing pairs to show hands
With mutation, if trans:
Cis-trans was a seminal test.

Set off by a cross, by decree,
Is the long Christcross-row, A to z,
Then an alphabet stew
Of "ba, be, bi, bo, bu,
Ab, eb, ib" ... an example or three.

Charlie Chaplin created The Tramp;
Rowland Hill did the same for the stamp.
But the symbol for et
From a Roman we get:
Freedman Tiro invented the amp.

I adjudge him one pudgy curmudgeon,
That judge who my case will be judgin'.
He's now in high dudgeon
With the law as his bludgeon.
I'll be trudgin' to jail. He's not budgin'.

When I wake up at night in my bed,
Many limericks race through my head,
But they all define P-words,
Not A-, B-, or C-words—
We won't get to P till I'm dead!

My reception was chilly I thought.
My Hello! earned an icy retort.
"So, you're back! What's the rush?
Are you over your crush
On that tart?!" (Trousers down—I'd been caught.)

They had painted the famed Monticello
Snowy white, but it's turning to yellow.
That bilging white paint
Made a home that was quaint
Look run-down, like a seedy bordello.

There's an issue on which few are mum:
Abortion (the thought makes me glum).
There are those who'd suspend it
While others contend it
Is private, an option for some.

When he fell on his sword, id est died,
Cleopatra, his lover, then cried,
"Hic jacet a Marcus
Antonius carcase,"
Soon prostrate, per asp, at his side.

I'm a dawdler. I simply won't hurry...
I refuse to be caught in the scurry
Of life. I move slower
Than you, friend... don't glower
At me. If we're late, what's the worry?

Politicians who vote for a war
After dodging one, decades before,
Earn the "chicken hawk" name;
It's a label of shame
For behavior that's hard to ignore.

Conterminous areas are
Side-by-side, so you needn't go far.
There's a boundary they share.
If you want to be there,
Just traverse it from here, in your car.

"Husband's working? Come on! Misbehave!
Hanky-panky's the thing we both crave."
CREAKING STAIRS!! "Hi, surprise!
Cancelled trip! Close your eyes!"
Through the window jump; scarper! Close shave!

What occurs deep inside of a cell?
Fluids circulate—liquid and gel—
That is known as cyclosis.
It will pause for mitosis,
Then begin in the new cell as well.

Her failures in love are extensive;
Her odor, it seems, is offensive.
Bath oil's sweet bouquet
Just might save the day,
But this skinflint declines.  Too expensive.

Such a gull, such a dolt, dumb as dirt!
What a deed you have done to subvert
And belie and devour:
You lack half the power
To harm as I have to be hurt.

On a long wooden plank made for girls,
As a man pirouettes, flips and whirls,
A 5.8 quake
Makes the balance beam shake:
And he slips down spread-eagle, and hurls.

A monk who is Turkish or Persian,
Who's embraced "pauper lifestyle immersion",
Should not make you nervous.
What he's called is a Dervis,
Or Dervise (an alternate version).

Enring: put a ring on or round
Like a moat that encircles a mound
With a castle on top,
Or a fence used to stop
Escapes from an animals' pound.

Hail, Caesar! This salad's for you —
Grown by Cassius, Casca and crew.
A conspiracy's not
The plot meant by this lot:
It's their veg plot. Hey, Brute — ate two?

Back up, or proceed in reverse,
When the space you intend to traverse
Has a gate or a bar
Right in front of your car;
Going forward is certainly worse.

A cupuliform cataract? Wow!
That must trouble your vision, 'cause now
Your posterior capsule—
Though there may be some gaps—'ll
Make everything cloudy—and how!

Have a look at this word that I've gotten.
The British now reckon it's rotten,
But Aussies and Yanks
Are still fond of it, thanks.
We've still got gotten's back, not forgotten.

Our dean was enraged and he ranted:
"That magician to whom funds were granted
To teach students tricks
Just made out with the chicks,
Who all laughed and declared, 'We're enchanted!'"

We elected a principled fellow
To Congress, who quickly turned yellow.
With his courage askew,
I'm ashamed by this true
Gutless wonder whose spine is like jello.

Got two coins for my birthday from Noah;
A hundred would make one balboa.
These centesimos are
Of less value by far
Than a dozen or so protozoa.

A fax machine's nifty, it's true,
When a document has to come through.
But a scanner's more green—
And a doc on a screen
Is cheap reading. So long, paper view!

I can see that my words you're ignoring.
And it's clear that you find me plain boring.
The plugs in your ears
And your chuckles and sneers
Don't hurt me—but please stop that snoring.

There is nobody, penny-wise, wiser.
He could work as a scrimping adviser.
He's a demon for thrift.
Even words get short shrift:
No econo is spared by this miser.

These extrapolated numbers you see
Are estimates we can agree
Are historically-based;
The numbers we chased
Date as far back as 1903.

'Twas Daggoo roused the crew just ere noon.
Queequeg sprung and he flung his harpoon.
The whale's flurry then splashed
The whole crew. How it thrashed!
Soaked, Stubb said, "Kill 'im dead—make it soon!"

First Abrasion, where skin's scraped or worn.
Then there's Puncture, from ice pick or thorn.
Next, Avulsion—a shock!
And Incision. (Thanks, Doc!)
Then Laceration, a wound badly torn.

I'm doomed, friend, to fry in the chair.
Please take charge of the grisly affair.
You are so executorial;
Write my memorial,
Cry, throw the switch, say a prayer.

When his comfy old jeans start to go,
And he's working and bending down low,
See a cleavage appear.
Hear "Tut-tut!" and "Oh dear!"
Builder's bum — not the best thing to show.

Willard Espy just loved the absurd-play
Of any weird words that he heard. Play
And words were as one
For that juggler bar none,
The wonderful wizard of wordplay.

She examined his face for some sign
Of approval. His smile was benign.
But you can't tell a book
By its cover's nice look.
Her request for a loan he'd decline.

Green fingers, that's what I ain't got.
Whatever I plant, it will rot,
And even my lawn
Is all yellow and worn.
In my garden I've quite lost the plot.

A cardiogram can be handy
For ensuring your heart is jim-dandy.
It's only a test
That your doc might suggest.
It is not a big heart filled with candy.

That the corpses were rotting was plain,
But the cannibals couldn't refrain
From devouring the dead,
Till cadaverine led
To the imminent rite of ptomaine.

State nicknames? Just one is the quota.
How strange that they seek to promote a
Wolf-like creature that's sly.
Can you please tell me why
The Coyote State means "South Dakota"?

Her hair's cropped; it's her signature do,
Cut so short that her scalp's showing through,
And the common belief
That it's everywhere brief
Is a subject I yearn to pursue,

Your hull may lose some of its polish
If you scrape past an iceberg that's smallish,
But a growler might flip
Your unfortunate ship.
And a bergy bit? More like demolish.

When playing outside, I just can't
Get enjoyment from soil or from plant.
But by bending the light
With a hand lens just right,
I can burn with a caustic. (Poor ant!)

His home brew's the last of the batch
He's been saving for Saturday's match.
With his pals he will sup,
And they'll shout for the cup
Between, "Cheers, mate! Chin chin! Down the hatch!"

Father's sisters were always bighearted.
I miss them.  They're newly departed.
In touch though they're dead?
My new medium said,
"Now say 'aunts' — it will help us get started."

The betel palm, growing in Asia,
Has nuts that will surely amaze ya.
Chew their kernels with lime
And you'll have a good time,
Though the stains on your dentures may faze ya.

Said Newton, "My fluxions, you see,
(Speaking infinitesimally),
Use dots and not dees,
And that, if you please,
Differentiates Leibnitz from me."

When I say I've got brandy on board,
I don't mean that I'm stowing a hoard
On a ship or a boat—
No, my liver's afloat,
And I'll drink 'til I've pickled my gourd.

When he died (due to bowel congestion?),
Alexander's great buddy, Hephaestion,
Was honored with games
Of which one of the aims
Was to make his name famous—no question!

His paintings in Florence are shown,
But Giovanni Cimabue is known
For winning fame's lotto
As teacher of Giotto —
Not so much for work done on his own.

"Hello, Dolly!" has caused me to drink so,
And to twitch and to jerk and to blink so.
It's too much, I submit!
Can you name one more hit
Carol Channing has sung? (Didn't think so!)

What's a death march? Three meanings, say I:
 People herded in groups—many die—
Or a pace slowly made
In a Christmas parade,
Or a bike ride that may go awry.

His cerebrovascular system
Has vessels. He's sure to enlist 'em
While wracking his brain
To the point where the strain
On his arteries threatens to twist 'em.

Our teacher will issue  a prize
For doubling the cube's (volume) size
With just compass and rule—
She must think I'm a fool,
Cause they won't do the job, I surmise.

On the farm, where he lived as a boy,
He honed skills that he'd later employ
Shipping livestock by sea.
Keeping watch is the key —
You should hear how he cries, "Sheep ahoy!"

The "method" director Lee Strasberg has
Taught many of Hollywood's crass burghers
To ape Hoffman's tricks
(Rainman's autistic tics) —
And that's only the tip of the Asperger's.

I've been  living with dire inflammation,
Because of my hip implantation.
The leg starts to heal;
Bones and tissue congeal:
It's a process called conglutination.

I'm sorry—here, have this begonia.
And I swear I've been trying to phone ya.
I would (*cough*) love to speak,
But I'm horribly weak
And I'm sick of this bronchopneumonia.

"I LOVE YOU," in welts on his back,
Shows his mast cells at work (there's no lack).
Dermatographism's made
With a line lightly laid
By a finger's or blunt object's track.

"What criteria, out in Nigeria,
Determine a case of diphtheria?"
"Well, there's fever, and swelling,
But the best way of telling
Is to culture a swab of bacteria."

Saying "Cobblers!" not linked to the shoe,
Just means "Nonsense!" and probably grew
From the term cobbler's awls
(Cockney rhyme slang for balls),
Though no doubt some will say, "That's not true!"

Those biologists claim with great pleasure
That these twosomes are life's greatest treasure,
But nitrogenous pairs
On their helical stairs
Are to me but a unit of measure.

Frenzied ministers' shrill exhortation,
Rabid right-wingers' sheer indignation,
And the noise of their peers:
They're invading our ears
With their rude amplitude modulation.

"It's Balsamic, this vinegar? Good!
How'd you make it?" some ask (as they should).
I reply, "How I wish
I'd used grapes in the dish!
It's not easy to stomp balsa wood."

We're the After Class Really Offbeat
New Youth Movement All Nude Indiscreet
Aggregation. Want in?
Simply show lots of skin
And say, "Acronymania's neat!"

Boston Blackie had no use for cops.
He thought most of them poor bungling flops.
An arch foe to the bad ones
And friend to the sad ones,
As a crime buster Blackie was tops.

Americans call it aluminum,
Metal so soft that a human, um,
Molds it too thin
And the noises come in.
Will somebody please stop that bloomin' hum?

Christianity's message was written
To stop people biting when bitten.
But though the idea
Worked well in Judaea,
I'm still gonna smite when I'm smitten.

To reproduce biogenetically,
A partner must please me aesthetically.
But those that I ask
Only take me to task,
Suggesting I try it synthetically.

A crayfish got caught in a crevice
In a creek to the north of Ben Nevis,
And swore, "I'm a crawfish
Who'll struggle to claw fish.
How awful I'm also called crevis."

Though the surgery's done with great skill,
Anesthesia can make folks feel ill,
So their surgeons are cautious.
For folks who feel nauseous,
Droperidol's just the right pill.

Old Beelzebub doesn't think well
Of Gregorian plainsong. "It's swell
For the angels," he'll sneer,
"But I won't have it here,
So don't ask me — there's no chants in hell."

Kit Carson, frontiersman, had grit.
And as Indian fighter? A hit!
He would make a good wage
Being brought on the stage
By a sidekick who bellowed, "Heeeeeeeeeere's Kit!"

A disputison? That's a dispute
And discussion combined. Ain't that cute?
Should we use this word more?
It's archaic, therefore
This disputison's probably moot.

With the "Riddle King" crown, Dad's adorned.
"You guys will not defeat me," he scorned.
"What word's got all five vowels
And in order?" he howls.
"The answer's facetious," he warned.

All your daily activities show
If your life's full of joy or of woe.
Can you eat, dress and talk?
Go to sleep, wash and walk?
Living just as you want, or so-so?

A black hole isn't much of a sight,
For intense gravitational might
Makes it dark, I recall,
Because nothing at all
Can escape from it, not even light.

I'm algesic, no stranger to pain.
I am achy again and again.
Every single last nerve
Transmits signals with verve.
Though it's normal, it seems like my bane.

"The book of the Law that you found,"
Noted Prophetess Chuldah, "has bound
You to quickly obey.
In its weasel-like way,
Time is gliding; your future's unsound."

Dried grass bound up tight is a source
Of cold-weather nutrition, of course.
I embale lots of hay
For my winter buffet —
I'm so hungry,  I eat like a horse.

Call a ciggie a gasper? That's wrong!
We need something more truthfully strong:
"Emphysema-promoting-
Black-tarry-lung-coating-
Addictive-white-tube" (naw, too long).

When I say, "Looks like rain," understand
I'm predicting foul weather, offhand.
Should I say, in some chat,
Something's arenoid, that
Could be translated thus: "Looks like sand."

I know aigre is sour or bitter.
I learnt that from my French baby-sitter
(He was handsome, I keen;
But I was just thirteen)
When I made him my first apple fritter.

When breezes conspire to blow,
Bits of pollen from flowers may go
On to fertilize plants
That are different. That's chance
And allogamy running the show.

Playing Yahtzee, I'd stepped on the dice box.
Our replacement? An old Spanish rice box.
But the dice were so cold
Every time that I rolled,
You would think I was using an ice box.

The Dark Continent, Stanley once said,
Was a place to be entered with dread.
The bravest explorer
Looked on it in horror
In knowing he might come back dead.

In the Sixties when folk songs were creed
Sang a singer yclept Susan Reed.
Autoharp she would play
In a folksinger's way,
And her lilting soprano we'd heed.

Walking east under amber delight—
A gold sky waving bye to the night—
I'm entranced by the changing
Of saffron shades ranging
Towards rose, while the blue clouds turn white.

Assortatively paired mate-to-mate
'Cause you look, act, and sound like your date?
While birds of a feather
May well flock together,
Being forced to is something they'd hate.

Young doctors: a good way to start
In your training, and show me you're smart,
Is to study anatomy.
Now, please don't be mad at me;
It's how you tell organs apart.

There once was a prude who'd deplore
My lewd limericks, but that was before
We hooked up.  Now she's keen
On the downright obscene.
"They're so dirty," she says.  "Tell me more."

It began with a few swollen glands;
Now there's swelling in both of my hands,
Which have gotten so dropsical
I dropped my last popsicle.
Now my hands can't meet nature's demands.

The young stewardess gave a light cough
As she gently reminded the toff,
"Our procedure is neat:
To be safe in your seat,
You must fasten your belt to take off."

Like scalpels, Acanthuridae
Slice past reefs neath the tropical sea.
Would these surgeonfish mind
If some shark were inclined
To pursue a physician's degree?

A fastidious girl, I attempt
To remain in the house if unkempt,
But what if a flood
Has me covered with mud?
There I am, out in public—verklempt!

He's a man, he's creative—what's wrong?
His formative spirit's too strong;
To his force, demiurgic,
I'm highly allergic:
I can't stand his presence for long.

Rate my date? I was very observant.
As a lover Minerva was fervent—
Yes, in bed she was zealous,
But sullen and jealous.
I enjoyed better sex with her servant.

In a blinding high wind, while it snowed,
Four wheel drive's tough abilities showed:
In a blizzard, a Jeep,
Faced with drifts six feet deep,
Plowed right through with no need to be towed.

Trump won, and the media follow
A narrative.  What do they swallow?
They fall for collusion
And draw this conclusion
From partisan hacks.  It rings hollow.

So badly they want to believe
That it's true.  Without question, they cleave
To this treasonous "fact,"
This impeachable act.
All this time, it's fake news we receive.

My toddler won't stop with his shticks!
I cooked matzah balls (not from the mix).
When I turned to the sink,
And before I could blink,
That ganef just ran off with six!

Bailey Forest is dense (lots of trees).
You can not wander through it with ease.
It's so thick, but you say
You would take just one day
To get through in your Cadillac? Please!

Some creatures exist in two forms,
So there isn't just one, but two norms—
That's dimorphism. We're
Man and Woman. Let's cheer—
We've the sexual type. That thought warms.

When it comes to the discharge of waste,
Be discreet as to where it is placed.
Be it large or petite,
When you need to excrete,
Please ensure that it cannot be traced.

"Integrated? Transistorized?" Hector
Protests, as a Luddite objector:
"Don't need your new cubes!
I don't even need tubes,
Just my trusty old crystal detector."

AIDS is the scourge of our time;
That it still kills so many's a crime.
With no cure still the rule,
Have safe sex (meaning, you'll
Use condoms) and live through your prime.

My skin isn't apt to seduce,
With these blisters that ooze and peel loose.
I've tried all sorts of gunge,
From green mud to axunge—
Still, I'd rather be me than the goose.

Avidya: it means I forgot
My divinity. That is my lot.
You see that old sod?
He thinks that he's God.
I am, but I think that I'm not.

Youthful fires are damped into coldness,
And our passions recede, due to oldness.
Though the riskiest chance
Offers charm and romance,
We choose safety, not impudent boldness.

Though you're witty, coruscant, and dashing,
Your hobby could send you down crashing,
For the glittering frost
May just bite — that's a cost
When in winter you choose to go flashing.

Our new grandchild, just born, rather small,
Is a boy whom his parents called Paul.
As our grandbaby, he
Fills us both with much glee,
But his screams drive me right up the wall.

This Vatican bull's a decree
That instructs every Catholic like me
Who is using the Pill
That we're thwarting God's will:
We must multiply—A.S.A.P.!

"If you miss this last game-winning basket,"
The coach said, "I won't blow a gasket.
I'll just rip out your heart,
Tear your body apart,
And then bury your bits in a casket."

A nutcase (or so I have heard),
Who owned and kept many a bird,
Would feed his poor parrots
On hundreds of carrots,
Which may well be rated absurd.

A manager dictates a lot
For a steno to scribble and jot.
The requirement thence is
A good amanuensis
To write what the others have not.

Some say astronavigation is fun.
First you start with a "sight" from the sun.
Next you do it again
With the moon, maybe.  Then
Plot the pair, find a match, and you're done.

Frankie Phelps held a knife when we met.
I broke out in a sudden cold sweat:
Now too hot, now a-shiver,
I cried, "Not my liver! —
Cut it out!" Said Mad Frankie, "You bet!"

Why does tax filing time cause such stress?
Wretched forms to fill out—it's a mess!
All confused, you say, "Heck!"
Then you write out a check
For what's due or, at least, your best guess.

I'm a dyed-in-the-wool allotheist,
And I'm not like your typical deist—
I worship my nose!
And, as one might suppose,
I'm its lone devotee and its pri-est.

In the government shutdown, Ted Cruz
Received blame.  "Even more seats we'll lose,"
Thought the GOP head.
But what happened instead
Was more red.  Now the Dems have the blues.

I was swooning with joy at his kiss,
And I asked, "Don't you think this is bliss?"
"Er — bliss for me, dearest,
Is finding the nearest
Urinal: I must have a piss."

A domain name's an address for sites.
Over good ones there often are fights:
IRS.com's one,
Google/Groovle — what fun!
And the winner takes all website rights.

The rum runners snubbed the loud plea
From the Coast Guard to halt by the quay.
They had nothing to lose,
So they scuttled their booze
And thus sank it, deep-sixed, in the sea.

See these curvative leaves, students, please?
Slightly undulate margins have these.
Now class, no one denies
That to leaves that applies;
And the same could be said of Louise.

Cried Cassandra, "Don't bring that Greek horse
Into Troy, or you'll feel great remorse!"
Could she prophesy? Yes.
But alas, one fine mess!
None believed her, so fate ran its course.

If our fields were all aquamarine,
And we cows came in pale shades of green
Mixed with hues of light blue,
Please vote "Moo" if it's true
We cud udderly fade from the scene.

First groundwork, then selling the "suits,"
Next production—it's time for first fruits.
Once promotions begin,
We'll start raking it in.
Every tween will need sandal-top boots.

As she painted the nails on her piggies,
The child said, "I'm just like you biggies."
She pretended to choke
On her make-believe smoke:
"Look — I'm smoking invisible ciggies."

In my future's remorse and remissitude
'Cause I've failed to find rhymes for vicissitude:
Wound that gapes in my mind —
Sutures bind, then unwind.
An unravelling that smacks of dehiscitude.

A worry-prone groupie named Beth
Wrote to Sting, "If you take every breath,
You'll asphyxiate us—
Which would not be a plus!
But regardless, I love you to death!"

Father John is a cleric and bearer
Of news that, by rites, should be rarer.
Seems a test will reveal
He's a father for real,
The result of a clerical error.

With each episode, Ella's aggression
Succumbs less and less to suppression.
Each occasion makes clearer
That day's drawing nearer—
We'll call for some skilled intercession.

"You can always, of course, change your mind.
If the one we supply you, you find
Doesn't suit, have a re-think,
And swap it." Makes me think,
My brain transplant team's too darn kind.

I've an uncle who takes evening ambles
With his dog, who's addicted to gambols.
Rover sniffed out a hare,
Chased it down to its lair;
Uncle Pete's stuck with thorns from the brambles.

Please step carefully, Ted, lest you tread
On this beautiful plant—dragon's head—
Dracocephalum. Hint:
It's related to mint.
I have bred it for years in this bed.

I stroll with my guy every day.
When an obstacle hinders our way
And held hands we must split,
If for only a bit,
"Bread and butter!" we lovingly say.

Deliberate defence—get this clear:
Of attacks from your side, I've no fear.
'Cause I'll cut all your wires
And I'll flatten your tyres,
So you won't have a chance to come near.

On some Internet sites, be aware
Of the myriad trolls who are there
Often lacking decorum;
I favor a forum
Where helpful advice we can share.

My love for my darling can vary
'Cause sometimes her legs can be hairy.
Should she epilate often
My feelings would soften
Towards her. She'd not seem so scary.

A sprite from Shakespearean drama
Once claimed it would cause him no trauma
To girdle the world
Ere an hour unfurled—
But he'd need a full year for yo mama.

Any surgeon who isn't a funge
Will make use of this thing to expunge
All traces of bleeding
From wounds he is heeding:
The absorbable gelatin sponge.

Read this bio of Einstein, contriving
To clarify; still I am striving
To fathom his quote
In that famed anecdote:
"When is Zurich to this train arriving?"

Monsignor Pierre's unendurable!
He's a dangerous man with his thurible.
When that priest swings his censer,
I wish skull bones were denser.
That accursed old curate's incurable!

To undermine Israel I've planned:
A diaspora — that would be grand!
As a true anti-Zionist,
I work with an eye on est-
ablishing an un-Holy Land.

I return to my woods, though I reckon
The bottles my love breaks the neck on
Are all drunk—as is she:
Her carousing's a plea
My own backcountry bacchant to beckon.

A hawker of chants (that's a chaunter)
Couldn't sell, and grew weaker and gaunter.
So he wrote one last song:
'I'll Be Gone Before Long,
If You Don't Stop and Buy As You Saunter'.

If they buzz a depressomotor nerve,
I will lose my elan and my verve;
I'll be slowed, like a slug.
A depressomotor drug
Does the same—so my doctors observe.

When I'm choosing a cloth for my face,
I have found it is always the case
That plain flannel is best,
With no family crest,
Sequins, tassels, or trimmings of lace.

Dressed in top hat and tails, Fred Astaire,
Night and day in the floodlights' bright glare,
Saw his tap-dancing style
Prove the best by a mile:
Charming heart-throb, a dancer with flair.

Rick fell down on the job and was canned
And from further employment is banned.
"When performance is down,"
Said his buddy, a clown,
"Tightrope walkers aren't much in demand."

"Will he chase other dogs in the park?
Will a knock at the door make him bark?
Will he sit? Will he stay?
Will he always obey?
Do you mind that I ask?" questioned Mark.

They jammed me right next to a loser (large).
On my next long-haul flight I will choose a large
Seat for my ass
With champagne in first class,
And a legroomy wide-bodied fuselage.

The PC police have us scared;
"Disparagement's out," they've declared.
So a fellow who's bald
Or dim-witted is called
"Something-challenged," instead of "impaired".

Red and dark is the wood, and it's rich;
From the acorns grow trees without pitch.
Jagged limbs spread the trees.
Leaves wide-lobed, set in threes:
They're the Kharshu brown oak. They'll bewitch.

Contemperation: old word for the act
Of tempering. Yes, but the fact
Is, since then we've arranged
That its meaning has changed
To "proportionate mix," quite exact.

"Should I give my wee baby a dummy?
The advice I receive is so crummy!
Will his teeth become wonky,
So he looks like a donkey?"
"I'm just two; dinnae fash yersel', Mummy."

Spicy chunks of roast chicken, dyed red,
Cooked in cream and tomatoes: it's said
To be favoured by Brits,
Though it gives them the squits
When on tikka masala they're fed.

An aqueduct's built to convey
The rainfall that fell far away.
Whether raised up on high,
Or unseen by the eye,
The water flows through, come what may.

There was once a Greek geezer named Aesop
Who loved talking the birds and the bees up.
Said a youth, "Act your age!"
"You mean senile, or sage?
I will make all the fables I please up!"

It is hard that a parent may leave you,
As the loss of their life may bereave you.
 It is terribly sad
 To lose mother or dad,
Because they were the ones to conceive you.

No matter how great your renown,
Should an Almack's grand patroness frown
And her cohorts agree
(Be you count or marquis)
You are gone from the ton of the Town.

An A-team's superior, though that
Won't mean that they won't have to show that.
It's not just a name;
They're deserving of fame.
I pity the fool who don't know that!

A word or a phrase that's amendatory
Is added in some ways compensatory
To put right a wrong,
In a rhyme or a song,
Deflecting critique that's condemnatory.

My godparents vowed to attend
To my spiritual health, so they send
Me to church every day
And demand that I pray.
Yet, to hell I'll get sent in the end!

It's a lung's and a honeycomb's cell,
And a pit in the stomach, as well.
It's a socket your fang
Can fit into, then hang,
And a bowl in a belemnite's shell.

My confusion with language is growing.
I don't know if I'm coming or going.
Rules? exceptions?—they fill
All my gray matter till
My poor head wants to burst from not knowing.

It's the opposite point on a sphere,
Just as far as can be from right here,
Where "right here" is a pole,
North (or South), in a role
That is counter to that of its peer.

Now with -oc-, side-by-side: collocation,
Which with -iqu- now let's melt: colliquation.
We'll find collineation
In collaboration.
This collection of words: a collation!

When left with a bowlful of giblets,
Mum crumbed 'em and made chicken niblets.
"They're entrails," we cried.
"They're delicious," Dad lied,
As he sampled the paltriest driblets.

This discarded used cardboard's my bed,
Where at night I can lay down my head.
It's cast off;  there's a lot—
Don't need mattress or cot.
It ain't fancy or cool, but 'nuff said.

Do you know what they mean when they say
Amish golf?  Do you know how to play?
Are your balls made of wood?
Are your wickets in good?
Would it help if we called it croquet?

Dana's cavedaughter deigned to remark,
"Dad, our dim, dingy  cave needs a spark!"
"It's a problem I'll handle—
I'll cook up the candle
So you won't go on cursing the dark."

An aging first-baseman named Jake
Didn't care for poached salmon or steak —
Spent his life on the hunt
For a major-league Bundt:
It's a hit — it's a doughnut-shaped cake.

"Hey, Jacques, check this rock out!" I cry.
"See the pressure-bands, clear to the eye!
Some are white, some are gray!"
But then Jacques walks away—
Well, perhaps he's just not a gneiss guy.

My friend was a very late bloomer,
A joker and squirt gun consumer.
When his aim went awry,
I got shot in the eye.
I'm a victim of aqueous humor.

The Hawaiian style shirt (aka
An aloha shirt), now here to stay,
Is the good-time attire
When you want to aspire
To look groovy and surely not gray!

All blackmailers, modern and olden,
Keep victims abjectly beholden
For goods they have tendered,
Or services rendered,
But, most of all, silences golden.

Upon leaving the desert, I packed us
A crate filled with claret cup cactus.
The Mojave has mound
Cactus growing all 'round;
It's the hedgehog that's sure to attract us.

Trailing tailfeathers held in a V,
Boat-tailed grackles live close to the sea.
They are mimics. I heard
One give proof — not a word
But a camera's click-whirrr: Picture me!

"No challenging questions here, please.
Pave my road to the White House with ease."
And so who do we thank?
All the press in the tank
Who, with softballs, made winning a breeze.

A car trunk (or British: a boot)
Is a storage compartment. En route
It will hold five large bags
(All your shoes and your rags)
Plus your fife and your flute. It's a beaut!

"Did Dot diet?  I think she looks bonier,
And her skin now looks healthy and tonier."
"As a rich surgeon's wife,
She's been under the knife;
Those improvements?  They don't get much phonier!"

All the evidence shown has been damning.
The defense team had better start cramming.
All the witnesses swear
About who, what and where.
Soon the jury may set jail doors slamming.

In his sermons he mixed up Cabala
With visions of Odin's Valhalla;
But in spite of this wallowing,
He had a great following—
At the service he served wine and challah.

Years ago, of Yvonne you were fonder.
Now your coldness has caused me to ponder
Why you're no longer friends.
Can it be how she spends?
She's a dingthrift;  your money she'll squander.

No help could be offered by docs in
The fight with diphtheria toxin
In great-grandfather's day.
Death came quickly that way.
Here's the grave that they buried his box in.

Amnesiac characters star
In movies whose plots often are
About solving a crime
When one's memory's not prime
While avoiding a booby-trapped car.

"It's a dundathu pine!" exclaimed Mike
When he came across one, on his hike.
Tree's identity card?
Its wood's not as hard
As the kauri's, though both look alike.

There was once a failed fakir from Seoul
Who applied rather hotly for dole,
For despite risk of burning,
He'd tested a yearning
To sleep on his bed of hot coal.

The good Brahmans are priests from a caste.
They're nonviolent. This structure should last,
Since their wives would be pure
So their children are sure
That they're part of their father's proud past.

Atalaya is sort of a house
Built for Huntington, Anna and spouse,
In a Moorish-like style.
They found it worthwhile,
But its strangeness made other folks grouse.

Keep your eye on this stunning beginner.
His forthcoming movie's a winner,
In previews. But soon
He'll make teenagers swoon,
Go all dopey and start skipping dinner.

I got crosswise with ol' Whisky Pete,
When I bragged my ol' nag could defeat
His new bay at the track;
Now there's no goin' back—
Fifty bucks says I'm gonna get beat.

My pole dance is gripping, enthralling.
But my parents opine it's appalling
That their daughter's whole goal
Is to scroll round a pole;
Being Polish, I say, "It's my calling."

My gasoline buggy, the source
Of my pride, will be setting the course
For the future.  You'll like
Your own motorized trike
And not dealing with smells from a horse.

Howie's prototype vehicle tried
To fulfill Army needs, but its ride—
Bellies down—provoked laughter,
Though led sometime after
To gains that the Jeep would provide.

Saint Thomas, the doubting Apostle,
In the gospel caused scandal colossal,
As he'd only believe
What his eyes could perceive.
What a silly (or was he?) old fossil!

Frozen ground, and the twigs tipped with frost?
Autumn leaves are all gathered and tossed?
Then the season that's here
(Though it won't last all year)
We call brumal: late sunshine is lost.

It's making me whine, fume and fret—
I'm totally mad and upset.
I have moved out of range—
Broadcast area change—
My station can't reach me here yet.

When you're telling some guy to go hang it
And want a real strong way to slang it,
But wish to sound clean,
Not profane nor obscene,
Just admonish the dude, "Hang it, dang it!"

As Kepler believed, it's a fact:
When spheres have been properly stacked,
They fill space in 3-D
With the least volume free.
That arrangement's denoted close-packed.

A beer garden snack sure to please,
Often partnered with pretzels, one sees.
It's made in that area
Known as Bavaria—
Allgauer Emmentaler cheese!

You say football's a sport you adore?
That's a pass that we've all heard before.
Your backfield's in motion,
To sack you've a notion,
It's clear that you're looking to score.

I swear that your treason will cease;
If I must, then your soul I'll release.
Although Cato's a wraith,
Carthaginian faith
Always finds Carthaginian peace.

Dinornis: no wings to take flight
And too bulky to hide out of sight,
It was hunted galore.
Ain't around any more—
Went extinct, the poor moa bird's plight.

The moisture continues to seep
Through our shoes on the links as we creep
Past the puddles today.
Golf's not easy to play
When the casual water's this deep.

Said Blanche to a blancher, "I say,
If you keep this food boiling all day,
All the flavor you'll lose,
Not to mention the hues,
And you'll just have to throw it away."

A vain, egotistical bloke
Tried, through newspaper ads, to convoke
An uproarious crowd
Who would cheer him out loud
And would bellow "AMEN!" when he spoke.

For years my TV was 3D —
Tall and wide, but as deep as the sea.
That's all ancient and stolid:
The picture's now solid,
While sets are as flat as can be.

Will is aerodynamically wise
To go cycling so hard with the guys.
Plus, those pads that enhance
What he has in his pants
Keep this guy out in front. (Girls: it's lies.)

The body began to  decay
At the foot of the bed, where it lay.
He had murdered his spouse
In their house—what a louse!
'Twas the odor that gave it away.

'E lies prone on 'is whistle, the coot,
And 'e puffs on 'is little cheroot.
As 'e blows rings of smoke,
'E be low, this 'ere bloke,
For 'e loves to be flat on 'is flute.

Aphrodisiac-makers demand
That Plato's Symposium be banned.
Its claim that affection
Is best sans erection
Does not help their market expand.

My wife Jane, looking grim, had a scowl.
My girl Betty let out a long howl.
I'd played a cruel trick —
Said I ate Bet's fave chick.
Both both cried for the fowl and cried foul.

From cyclo-, its shape is a ring,
And from -hexane, a six-carbon thing.
Blurry ring-flipping flair
Morphs from "boat" into "chair"
And then back, like a hummingbird's wing.

"Had you fought like a man, you need not
Have been hanged like a dog." What a shot
To receive from one's wife
At the end of your life!
What is known of this gal? Not a lot.

If at summits you strive to arrive,
You will  summon a drive that's acclive.
When it's down you must go,
And in very deep snow,
Routes declive will best keep you alive.

Worried Wes, "This recession ain't funny,
And I frequently fret about money."
But his great-grandma Gertie
Recalled 1930
And told him, "Just deal with it, Sonny."

You may need, if a wound's on your skin,
Prepared animal membrane that's thin.
This covering, cutin,
Protects (no disputin')
And helps to let healing begin.

Aging spirits and wine makes 'em good,
But distillers have long understood
Some is lost. We're aware
Of dispersal to air
(Angel's share). Devil's cut's lost to wood.

The mahogany knife here displayed
Has a thin and elongated blade.
It's a cream-slice—employed
By my grandfather Floyd
To cut ice cream my grandmother made.

Of adactylia one might suppose
There's no benefit anyone knows.
But one thought yet lingers—
If you're born without fingers
You're never caught picking your nose.

You have gone out to lunch with your parrot;
And the salad looks good, so you share it.
Then you suddenly note
There's a lump in his throat—
Lor'! Your parrot, 'e's choked on a carrot!

Creatophagous, Ed's son likes meat.
"It's nutritious, and all that I eat."
He declares, "When I've dined
With my sister, I find
Eating carrots I feel like a cheat."

An artillery shell slammed down (thud)
Near my foxhole and sprayed me with mud.
I, quick, fell on my face,
But through luck or God's grace,
No explosion ensued. 'Twas a dud.

In these clerical books I've been delvin'.
They're by Calvin, you fool, not by Kelvin,
And this Calvin's named John.
No, his name is not on
The Nobel, 'cause that Calvin's called Melvin.

My three-year-old daughter is bossy;
She's often as rude as she's saucy.
So when the kids dance,
She watches them prance,
Critiquing them just like Bob Fosse.

He staggers home drunk, what a mess!
How he gets there is anyone's guess.
As he wobbles and coggles,
The mind simply boggles:
Does he have an innate GPS?

As I stepped through the door, spirits soaring,
I expected the joint to be roaring.
I was sure I would score
With two dames, maybe more,
But the party was dullsville—just boring!

She said, "What are you getting at, Mike,
When you ask what positions I like?
Like in baseball, you mean?"
No, his thoughts were obscene.
The light dawned, so she said, "Take a hike!"

Furfuration, in Webster's, I've read
Is a "falling of scurf from the head."
There's another notation:
It says "desquamation."
Why not just say "dandruff" instead?

I must have done something to peeve her.
(Where's my spaniel? My golden retriever?)
My bird dogs can flush
Any "bird" from the brush.
(If she doesn't come home, can I leave her?)

A man from near Lago Maggiore
Made salad like none seen before.  A
Cardini by name
Achieved worldly acclaim
For his Caesar, the taste we adore, eh?

Autocannibalism: you eat
Some parts of your body. It's meat.
Like your butt or your belly.
You think this is smelly?
Some cannibals think this is neat.

Divisionists painted in spots
Of pure color. These tiny bright dots
Were the mark of divisionism,
Not at all like precisionism;
Lots of clots, for that style, were "do nots".

Some reforms cause political storms,
Thus upsetting free enterprise norms.
CCF taught its group
All the socialist poop—
Education takes multiple forms.

Sheriff Struther's informing his men:
"That sly crime gang has struck once again:
Those unscrupulous boys
Don't steal money — just toys.
And not one of them's older than ten."

Is your shtick like a redneck's or hick's?
Do your jokes make folks snicker? Do chicks
Find your cracker-barrel humor
Falls flat? There's a rumor
You'll fail—even out in the sticks.

There's a poker game Saturday night
In which all of the guys take delight.
Their wives raise no tiff,
So it comes down to if
My control unit gives the green light.

Though I've only betrayed a small fraction,
Toward this patient I feel great attraction.
I am filled with elation
When she has inflammation—
She displays such acute-phase reaction!

Sandra Dee's early films were released
Back when teenage boys' hair was all greased.
She was young and alive,
And those movies survive,
Although Sandra herself is Dee-ceased.

When composing  a shrewd editorial,
Editorialist Joe, in his oriel,
Is thinking of schemes
For his text, as he dreams
It will be for a written memorial.

You are cross-eyed, my friend, I maintain.
You deny it? Then let me explain.
Your chiasm serves
To reroute optic nerves
To the opposite side of your brain.

Young Goldilocks, 'bout whom you've read,
Had lain down, when she jumped up and said:
"It's set me to giggling,
My mattress is wriggling,
Some bawdy's been jiggling my bed!"

Tie the bungee cord. Jump! Now you're dropping.
At the end of your rope, you'll be stopping.
Then you bounce up and down,
But at last, like a clown,
You just hang, swinging loosely (or flopping).

Spirits dwell in all things: Though simplistic,
This phrase can define animistic.
Just the thought makes me cower—
That mat in my shower?
I fear it would turn voyeuristic.

The intent of the primitive cross?
Crucifixion—in essence, the loss
Of a life, by decree,
On a pole or a T—
Like the death of the Son of the Boss.

The opera on Faust (his damnation)
Tells the tale of a scholar's temptation.
Though his fate is alarming,
Mephisto is charming,
And Gretchen is promised salvation.

He's a fledgling insurgent, it's true,
But he's under my wing, so don't stew.
Though he's new to this fight,
He's both stalwart and bright;
He can help us to hatch a new coup.

Last winter we formed a cabal
To recover the rule of Transvaal.
But now Google insists
It no longer exists,
And we're lost in Kwazulu-Natal.

With the boss I was overly flip,
Plus I gave the chief foreman some lip.
He returned in a wink
With a slip that was pink;
But I hid, so I gave him the slip.

With a mike on a tubular stand
And an earpiece you held in your hand
The candlestick phone
Was the greatest thing known
Until cradle phones. Then it got canned.

If drunk driving is shown to be true,
Then this victim is likely to sue.
With the driver to blame,
It might well launch a claim,
And some blood money may become due.

It helps how your muscles will feel,
But use caution: the danger is real.
Rub aconite on
And your pains may be gone—
But don't eat it, or that's your last meal.

Forget thoughts that grim headlines evoke
About earthquakes, shelled buildings and smoke.
Read instead about debs,
Major stars and celebs.
Gossip columnists feature such folk.

To glaze your pots, biscuit or bisque
In the kiln first, to cut down the risk
That the clay may deform
In the glaze, wet and warm,
And your bowl could end up as a disc.

Bond, while listening to wiretaps, heaves
A big sigh as he turns the log's leaves,
But then Bond spies a blonde
And so fails to respond
To the ninjas who drop from the eaves.

The playwright collapsed on the floor
When told that her show was a bore.
She called her clichés
"Archetypal displays,"
But the critics had seen it before.

You're adherently sticking like glue.
You remind me of cling wrap, you do.
You're attached at my hip.
Baby, loosen your grip.
Give me space or, my darling, we're through.

Though the NFL strikers were mocking,
The thespian stand-ins came knocking.
You could tell from the start
When a play fell apart,
They would blame its demise on bad blocking.

A from allgemein, oh, that is German;
D as Deutscher, we therefrom determine;
A means Automobil;
C is Club, we reveal:
Triple-A, but for Schorsch, not for Sherman.

The young and the rich and the pretty,
The greatest, the gifted, the witty:
Adjectival nouns all,
Like the handsome, the tall —
And I'm none of them, more is the pity.

I'd be sleeping in beds if I could,
But I couch surf with friends in the 'hood.
Since I lost my own place,
I'm a charity case.
How'm I doin'? Well, sofa so good.

If it seems that you merely survive —
Just exist — don't feel thankful or thrive,
Simply pause for one breath —
Not to think about death,
But to savour that instant alive.

Puff pastry's a fine flaky eat
When it's filled with sweet mince.  Take a seat:
We've been Eccles cake-making.
The smells from our baking
Mean teatime today holds a treat!

They're colloguing, they've something in store.
Those old rascals are scheming once more.
Once the play's underway,
Some poor sucker will pay.
Sure, they're scoundrels, but never a bore.

"Price of coffee's gone up — it's sky high,"
Moaned Sir Oliver Pilkington-Pie.
"Yes, I had to look twice,
As the usual price
More than doubled since Friday. Oh, my!"

From 'Frisco to B.C.'s wild straits
I go sailing with sea-going mates,
And when weather turns foul—
Crashing waves, winds a-howl—
Sails are reefed, till the fierce storm abates.

"Blarney Castle's a cheese that's been shown
To be made from stuff naturally grown."
"Do you eat it to grow
Highly talkative?" "No,
You're confusing the cheese with the stone."

I've provided my birdie a billet.
There's a tray in this cage, and I fill it
Each morning with seeds,
So my parakeet feeds
On his thistle, canola, and millet.

A bolt without threads on its shaft
Is a true definition of daft.
When a bolt-threader cuts
Spiral grooves, then the nuts
Can assist in the fastener's craft.

My ear-minded son thinks  in sound,
While his eye-minded twin drifts around
And envisions his hopes.
That's how each of them copes.
But both dream with their feet on the ground.

Boston Harbor is subject to breezes
That worsen in weather that freezes.
It took sixty screw sets
To fix MASSACHUSETTS
Against anti-billboard reprises.

When I'm making my floral selections
For ladies who share my affections,
"Biacuminate, please,"
I will ask for, since these
Have two points but in different directions.

For a time, The Association was great:
'66, '67 & 8.
This band of six men
Had five hits, all top ten.
After that, their success would deflate.

They told us in school that Alaska
Should not be confused with Nebraska,
Which not at all boasts
The possession of coasts—
But neither's got Lake Athabasca.

If Shakespeare has somehow amassed a
Sufficiently large plate of pasta,
He won't shout "Enough!"—
Extra serves to rebuff—
You're more likely to hear him cry "Basta!"

To observe the right star in the sky,
Aim your gaze up exactly so high.
But describing that angle of
Elevation's a tangle of
Numbers I cannot supply.

Fedayeen al-Islam, fierce and canny,
Is a militant group — Pakistani;
Such groups we should bill as
Determined guerrillas
Who're happy to bump off your granny.

By a mentor, our club members guidedly
Were taught manners, and yet we decidedly
Would fail to agree,
So each meeting would be
An encounter that ended dividedly.

Consider your arm, and then bend it;
Initiate motion, then end it.
Your biceps' contraction
Is causing the action;
The triceps is used to extend it.

Her radiant smile expressed joy
As she lay on the beach in St Croix.
She was beaming. Tom Cruise
Then delivered great news:
"Congratulations, my love. It's a boy!"

The cephalochordate is prone
To hide in the sand when it's grown.
It is shaped like a sword,
And its nerves form a cord,
But it hasn't a spine made of bone.

I've one eye.  I look rather Cyclopic,
And I tend to be slightly myopic.
Editorials, too,
Have but one point of view—
But the damnable print's microscopic!

My wife's lovely and lively: a catch,
And it seems we're a pretty close match.
But I've just met her sister
(Kind of sorry I'd missed her),
Who might be the pick of the batch.

After cutting out patterns all day,
Lots of cabbaging I'd put away.
Now some cabbaging lout
Stole it all—wiped me out.
He's got cabbage, and I'm left with hay.

To a damp, all of Mudville succumbed,
As the depths of depression we plumbed.
Every man in the stands,
Maybe 5,000 fans,
Had seen Casey strike out. We were bummed!

Haul the sled to the top—one more heave—
For a run no one else can achieve.
Pad our elbows and knees.
Whizz as fast as we please,
On the snow, down the brae or the cleeve.

At the rear of the palace dispensary,
Alchemists used a descensory
To bring to a boil
Live frogs (for their oil),
Never thinking such toil reprehensory.

My favorite show has an airtime
Coinciding with washing-my-hair time.
With tow'l on my head...
A TV by my bed...
I enjoy goofing off in my spare time.

The set of those choosing the pope
Has a number of members (who hope
That they all will agree
Who the pontiff will be):
That's the set's cardinality, dope.

Apriorism: that's how I reason,
Although others may not find it pleasin'.
I assume, then I act,
And don't care about fact—
It sustains me from season to season.

"Stones are cumbrous," says Sol, "as a rule.
This huge sandbag? A load for a mule.
But both burdens combined
Are less weighty, you'll find,
Than the heavy brute wrath of a fool."

The time of the exody neareth,
And that journey proud Moses he feareth—
But God cleaveth the Sea
And his people are free
As the Pharaoh's wet host disappeareth.

When the pollen count's high in the breeze,
And you know that you'll soon start to sneeze,
Lose that droop in your mug!
Give your druggist a hug,
And say, "Give me acrivastine, please!"

Here's the scene where the sheriff walks in—
The bar's packed. The tough bad guy has been
In wait—Pow!—throws a punch.
Bedlam's loosed (crash, bam, crunch)!
Villain's floored, law prevails, end of din.

The diet of storks (Ciconiidae)
May include certain moths (the Arctiidae)—
But a bird of that size,
As it flies through the skies,
Needs more calories, thus tries Ariidae.

In that ode, Schiller's words flowed like water.
"Wax effusive, yes that's what I oughter!
Joy's not born of this world,
But from Heaven unfurled.
I shall call her 'Elysium's daughter.'"

If the serious drinker's fulfilment
Is the act, and result, of distilment,
Then consider how Jack
Came adrift from the track
When he found out exactly what Jill meant.

Willie Dewar, a prosperous brewer,
Found his sales became markedly fewer
When folks came to hear
How he thickened his beer
With a clot of red blood cells, or cruor.

For the etymological geek,
There's a prefix we've taken from Greek.
It means "near," "over," "on,"
"At," "before," or "upon":
Epicentral to language we speak.

Scrolls are thrifty, and frugal moreover,
For I cut and re-use what's left over.
Half-blank codices' pages
Eat book-makers' wages;
For merchants of vellum, they're clover.

I'm late and I can't miss this train!
It's arrived, and I'm here, yet in vain:
I must climb down these stairs,
But some guys, broad as bears,
Have me blocked—all my plans down the drain.

My tough boss?  Productivity-driven!
To shell bushels of nuts I had striven.
He yelled, "Hurry! You're lacking
In effort! Get cracking!"
(A mere fifteen pounds had I riven.)

We built models quite carefully scaled
And made plans that were finely detailed.
Once the heist came to pass,
What a triumph! First class.
The enactment could hardly have failed.

Astronomers, wanting to see,
Measure stars through a filter named V—
Also B, teamed with U,
Where the B stands for blue;
In their differences, color is key.

Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose writing
Has passages solemn and biting,
Contemplatively mused
On men's foibles. He used
A slow style, but his tales were exciting.

Cruciverbalists learn crosswordese,
Filling puzzles with words such as these:
Dies irae and busto —
Less-used words that you must know
To solve crossword puzzles with ease.

The aerophagist, swallowing air
In hysteria, simply won't care
That the belching it causes
Might lead to guffaws—his
Concern's his alarm and despair.

Down my arm runs my cubital nerve,
To my hand. At my elbow's a swerve
Where it's apt to be hit.
I don't laugh, I admit.
"Ooh! My funny bone hurts," I observe.

If you suffer from gout or arthritis
Or postoperative pain or phlebitis,
Acemetacin may
Take your symptoms away—
Or it may simply give you gastritis.

The game warden gave me a ticket
Cuz I shot up a bear in a thicket —
I had broken the law.
Well, I cut off a paw
And I told him the place he could stick it.

An exhibit where donkeys amass
Is on view to the public through glass.
One day at this zoo
A blind donkey broke through
And encountered a pane in the ass.

Beware of the hazards that lurk
In the name of the Icelander, Björk:
She'll let out a squawk
At "Buh-yorrk" or "Buh-jawk";
Mispronouncing it drives her berserk.

When a book's out of print, Bernadette,
Shops can order no more, but don't fret!
In a specialist store
A facsimile (or
A reproduced copy) you'll get.

My acromial spurs have appeal,
Poking up on each shoulder; I feel
Absolutely no pain,
And the practical gain?
To hold shoulder straps on, they're ideal.

When I'm milking my favorite cow,
I'm turned on — I'm like all here and now.
For this act of emulgence
I crave her indulgence.
But she likes it also — and how!

Six short weeks in your womb—that's the norm
For an embryo's earbuds to form,
Rudimentary, sure,
And still short of mature.
Soon she'll hear you—your songs—and feel warm.

"Religious retreats help me grow
So much closer to Christ.  Wanna go
On this next one with me?"
She had asked.  Golly gee,
Stronger bonds with the Lord?  Thank you, no.

I'm pleasingly plump and still single.
With the opposite sex, I can mingle.
If I think of a mate
Then I contemplate fate,
With my cute, chubby body atingle.

Keeper's gloved it — "HOWZZAT! Caught behind?"
The old ump shakes his head. (Shouldn't mind,
But we all heard the nick,
The sharp [click] of a snick;
And saw movement.  This ump's deaf and blind.)

Keep on walking. In Ryde (Isle of Wight),
You will soon reach the caravan site.
Then bear left, and you'll see
A large sycamore tree.
When you get to a crossroads, turn right!

There's a drive-in in town; it's not far,
And their star this week's Hedy Lamarr.
You drive in, pay admission,
Switch off the ignition,
And watch the whole film from your car.

Increasing the heat flux in boiling
Past critical values is spoiling:
Hot vapor jets keep
Off the liquid to sweep
The hot wall, which, at burnout, is toiling.

To confirm the connection is tight,
Keep the nut held in place, then recite:
"Turning left makes it loose,"
And from that you'll deduce
You should thus turn the bolt to the right.

That damn call button jockey, room 9,
Is a pain in the base of my spine.
For no reason he rings
About minuscule things.
His sole purpose? To hear himself whine.

An E-field divergently goes
Out from any qe that you pose,
While an E-field enringing
Means B-fields are swinging,
Or circles qm as it flows*.

A B-field divergently goes
Out from any qm that you pose*,
While a B-field enringing
Means E-fields are swinging,
Or circles qe as it flows.

*Is it fiction? Well, nobody knows.

Though Joe's hidden his crimes very well,
There are secrets his girlfriend might sell
To the press. They'll come out
In the wash; and, no doubt,
Both the cops and his wife will raise hell.

Although once I would make my son, Ron, do it,
I've a new way to drain off my pond, to wit:
A long hollow pipe,
So now Ron doesn't gripe,
For it acts — true to type — as a conduit.

I'm Glaswegian and sometimes I've found
Glasgow turns, after drink, round and round.
I'm a Glasgow-born chap
And relieved my mishap
Only happens (I'm old) on home ground!

This acid displays dibasicity.
Two H ions don't mean duplicity.
Each of them's spaced
To be neatly replaced,
Forming salts with a double felicity.

How do  auxotrophs  ever survive?
Are there settings in which they can thrive?
When factors they've made
Have started to fade,
The wonder is: they're still alive!

A fast-handed felon is Fred,
Who will rob his own mother, it's said.
When the Reaper comes by
Stingy Freddie won't die,
'Cause he'll cop Reaper's sickle — Death's dead!

There are thoughts that just bypass my brain,
Blurted out with no filter. In vain,
Whether wicked or droll,
I have tried self-control,
But a lack of restraint is my bane.

Apaid has two meanings conveyed:
First there's "pleased," as when smiles are displayed.
Then there's "paid." In this way,
You could easily say:
"When my bills are apaid, I'm apaid!"

"The pirates are running, God rot 'em.
Run the bow-chaser out. When we've caught 'em,"
Said the captain, most stern,
"They've a lesson to learn,
So we'll give 'em a slap on the bottom."

I recently suffered a scare
And have since been beset by despair.
But that trend's been reversed,
And I'm over the worst:
I'll bounce back from this crisis, I swear.

My other co-workers revile 'em,
But me, I just process and file 'em.
They govern our day
So much, you could say
That the lunatics run this asylum.

My blonde girlfriend, a little bit queer,
Doesn't think "when day's dawning is here"
Is what's meant by auroral:
"Prefix aur-, suffix -oral
Pertains to you nibbling my ear."

A bee, busy buzzing and humming,
Found her humdrum existence benumbing,
So she tried the effects
Of some afternoon sex.
What a satisfied bee she's becoming!

If you render a rainbow in paint,
Then its pure spectral colours just ain't.
But the paint's chromaticity
Fools your eyes with felicity,
And you'll find there's no cause for complaint.

Christianity converts are pressed
To learn doctrine; they're put to the test.
Catechumens get versed
In the discipline first,
And then baptism winds up their quest.

Aetiology wants to know why
All that is is the way it is. I
Do not actually care,
But suspect that somewhere
There's a cause I could blame if I try.

Did we leave other primates behind
When we lost our bicameral mind?
Asymmetrically deft,
Into houses we're cleft,
And in each, different treasures can find.

Let's consider the black-handed titi:
Like so many, this monkey's a sweetie.
It's diurnal; arboreal;
Clannish; territorial;
Small, though, and not very meaty.

"Fellow traveler? A pinko? A Red?
A Commie? A Leftist?" she said.
"No. I think it is plain
We're both riding this train
On our honeymoon, now that we've wed."

For an afternoon under the sun,
The great Aussie arvo's such fun:
On sausages, munch
At our barbecue lunch.
"Chuck a snag on the barbie!  Well done!"

Here's a riddle: What word stands for three
Different parts of the body? The key:
There's the chin (when it's hit),
And the nose (cute, a bit),
And the clitoris. What could it be?

If it's cartop, it fits on the roof
Of your car, and it's light. Here's the proof:
You can drive it about
And your tires won't blow out
In a poof—which would sure be a goof.

A detestable piglet named Hamet
Stubbed a toe; told his ma, "Now exam it!"
Ma said, "It might be
Your toe B." Then said he,
"It's toe B, or it's not toe B, damn it!"

"The grizzlies are calling!" says Hugh,
Your new love. "Let's go back to the zoo!"
This ursine obsession
Is showing progression.
I think he bears watching, don't you?

The sideshow conjector said, "Lad,
I would guess you're an Antioch grad.
You weigh one fifty-two,
And your middle name's Lou."
Not impressed, I said, "Very good, Dad."

You're defined by the men in your life
With an overdependence that's rife.
Clinging vines like you take
A back seat, but you'll make,
For a chauvinist pig, a fine wife.

I have finished the first fifty-four
And my stomach's so full that it's sore,
But your cakes are so good
That it's well understood:
I am eating another (one more).

As neat as two balls in their socket,
Bipropellants fit snug in a rocket.
There the two precious fuels
Are like Britain's Crown Jewels,
Lying safe, side-by-side, in a pocket.

Wrote the ornithological nerd,
"I describe a dimorphic new bird …
Note the male is so small
And the female so tall,
When they mate, he's dispatched by a turd."

If the foremast bends sternwards, don't fret.
Sailors know how to fix it, I'll bet.
They would tighten the forestay.
It is not an "ignore" stay.
Once they make taut that line, they're all set.

A vertebra high on the spine;
A plant stem or offshoot; a line
Of rotation, direction,
Symmetric reflection:
(It's axis I chose to define.)

Analgesics eliminate pains.
Overdoses degenerate brains.
They're needed for buffering
Aches one is suffering,
But never for pains that one feigns.

What's the worst kind of person? A liar!
Verbal honesty's what I admire.
Even children, I grant,
Share this trait. Hear them chant:
"Fibster! Fibster! Your pants are on fire!"

Said an actor (employed only rarely),
"Why must nature endow us unfairly?
That means that I can't
Be the new Cary Grant,
Since I'll never come off debonairly!"

Acts of clemency grant a reprieve;
They're a pardon the guilty receive.
You may be on death row
With just minutes to go —
Then they say 'You're set free!' and you leave.

In London I spent half a year
Eating bangers and mash, drinking beer.
Now my friends all complain
That my speech is insane.
You ask why? I am cockneyfied, dear.

Uncle Joe's most adept at his post
As executive chef and as host
Of a nationwide chain
Known as Breakfast with Jane.
Now he boasts his French toast's coast-to-coast.

Said a born-again Christian, "I pray
To the Lord up above every day;
I've a personal bond..."
I jumped in to respond,
"If it's personal, keep it that way."

We three friends plus the dummy play whist
After four hands are dealt—that's the gist.
We're becoming old fools
Who lose sight of the rules—
It's quite common to hear "Stick" or "Twist".

Under "power, atomic" you'll see
Just how mystical physics can be.
You'd note E (if you cared)
Equals m times c squared,
But beyond that is way beyond me.

Some children in public are brattish,
Obnoxious, annoying, and rattish.
Their behavior is rude,
It's disruptive and crude:
And frankly, they drive me quite battish.

When the salt in the shaker's not shaking,
It's because of ionic bond braking.
Merely add some white rice,
Shake to mix, flow is nice.
Breaking clumps makes white rice anti-caking.

From the jury—a perjury quiz
For Bill Clinton—here's why he's a whiz:
They were fallibly led
As he pretty much said,
It depends on the meaning of "is".

Unobtrusive am I and discreet;
Not one confidence will I repeat.
I will use words with tact,
Show respect with each act;
With restraint my whole being's replete.

The president spoke with alarm
About cuts that, he said, would cause harm
So severe, but when that
Didn't work, he then sat
With his rivals and turned on the charm.

When Charity noted with clarity,
"Orphan children need schooling at parity
With their peers," many nations'
Commercial foundations
Gave money to Charity's charity.

"Two negatives," so said Miss White,
"Make a positive.  Try as you might,
Two positives can't
Make a negative, Grant."
At which Grant replied, smiling, "Aye right."

Deuteroscopy's not an exam
With a flexible tube and a cam;
See, my own second sight
Brings the hidden to light —
I'm very perceptive, I am.

Born advantaged? You're noble and rich.
Yet I'm hoping you might want to switch
 With this peasant who's poor
 For a week, maybe more.
Not a chance? You're a son of a baroness.

Since I know cayenne peppers are hot,
I really don't like them a lot.
Though their juice burns my hand,
All my sons think they're grand,
But it makes their breath smelly, like rot!

Cyberbullies are all put on notice.
"You must cease your attacks," warns the FLOTUS.
As First Lady her aim
Is to bathe them in shame.
Well, perhaps she should start with the POTUS.

"You blame me for your sins? Makes me sick!
And you think I get some kind of kick
Out of toasting lost souls
Over freshly fanned coals?
I've been demonised," grumbles Old Nick.

Aren't you new here? I thought so. How nice!
Give a yell if you want some advice.
Till you get up to speed
Let me know what you need.
(My companionableness breaks the ice.)

To make it through medical school
He would brownnose his profs as a rule.
He became (what a shock)
A proctology doc.
Go and see him.  Just pull up a stool.

"In their first year of college, I've seen
Many students fill out," said the dean.
"In kilos this weight
Is between six and eight,
Or in pounds it's the freshman 15."

A conference house is a base
Where reunions and meetings take place.
There are speeches and graphs,
And a mingling of staffs...
And a fling between Brian and Trace?

Sarah Bernhardt might now be thought quaint;
In her time she left playgoers faint.
They believed her when told
In her accents of gold
She was nineteen years old and a saint.

Don't miss out on those men in their prime
In October when baseball's sublime
And the best teams compete.
Baseball fever's a treat,
So remember to catch it in time.

"Let's shut the Republicans out.
We'll pass health care," the Dems said.  "No doubt."
But the votes they would lack,
So they tried a new tack:
"Hey, let's take the bipartisan route."

As though etherized, zonked, on a table,
He lies still on the floor of the stable.
Out cold, he's been thrown—
Not so much as a groan.
Doctor's coming… as soon as he's able.

Listen here pal, you sure ain't too quick.
In fact, you're amazingly thick.
I don't care if you're miffed,
So's you're getting my drift.
What I'm sayin' is you don't know dick!

"In the matter of Roe," seven say,
"Abortion is now A-OK!"
Now a babe in the womb
Could be sent to its tomb—
And the battle still rages today.

Badass Bogie, the actor, was class,
Both in rags or in tux, took no sass.
And that isn't all—
He had Lauren Bacall.
What a pair, what an act, what a gas!

Citrus greening's one dreadful disease;
Worldwide it's killed millions of trees.
Fruits turn bitter as hell,
Get misshapen as well:
And stopping it sure is no breeze.

I clock on, show my face, start the day
With a coffee—or three. It's a way
To earn cash, and I'm paid
Rather well for my grade—
Situation-wise, cushty, I'd say.

When some boys bought my bossies, it cost 'em.
My peewees and agates? I tossed 'em.
My alleys, I've found
(Alabaster, and round);
But the rest of my marbles? I lost 'em.

The president's got the Big Mo.
We're demoralized.  Spirits are low.
We're completely bummed out.
All signs point to a rout.
Any chance for an upset?  Y...No.

There's my managing partner. Oh, hey, Bob!
Dormant partners can sleep. What's a day job?
Sure, I play. I'm not shirking;
My cash does the working.
I'm the fat-cat investor and nabob.

A diviner who watches a crow
Will observe all its habits and know
From its eating and flight
What the future will write.
Such an auspice can prophesy woe.

They say buskin's a genre of acting,
On tragedies mainly impacting;
And its origin's cute—
It's a Greek actor's boot,
Laced and worn in a manner exacting.

Heavy breathing? A shocking assertion!
I'm panting from recent exertion.
When I run up the stairs,
All the effort impairs
Steady breathing: no phone-call perversion!

Let's face it, I know I'm a lush,
Getting red in the face as I rush
To imbibe every day
Three carafes of rosé.
Like the vino I drink, I'm ablush.

Mr. Anthony Comstock—he saw
Dissoluteness in George Bernard Shaw.
Shaw answered with mockery,
He laughed at comstockery
And called it America's flaw.

When a grizzly escaped from the zoo
And pursued 'em, Jack said, "We are through.
We've less speed than this bear."
Jill said, "Jack, I don't care,
Just as long as I've more speed than you."

I behaved like a meek little mouse,
You impossible two-timing louse.
I held back, I forbore,
But I'll take it no more —
Get your ass the hell out of my house.

Club Whoopee is great for romancing,
Accompanied nightly by dancing.
With their jazz band so hot
(They play Django a lot),
All your prospects, it's clear, you're enhancing.

Ecclesiasticus, known as Sirach,
Is a scriptural text, front to back.
It has proverbs and morals,
Advice to tame quarrels —
A book that the Protestants lack.

Mr. Peanut lived next to a mouse,
And the prejudiced rodent would grouse.
"Damned neighbor," he'd mutter,
"I'm a peanut-abutter,
So I'm leaving and selling my house."

They're just boys, all these brave new recruits,
Lacing up those high, brown combat boots.
Though their feet are protected
Their limbs are neglected;
They're hoping no enemy shoots.

Sherlock Holmes was asked how could it be
He had solved a crime quickly. Said he,
"Just observe the man's face.
It's a poisoning case.
Alimentary, dear Watson, you see."

That's a bugle call: short, brassy tune.
Preteen Jack learned to play one last June.
Every morning that devil, 'e
Loves to play Reveille —
Waking us all:  his "platoon".

As used here the adverb so neatly
Helps verses to rhyme much more sweetly.
I'll do it discreetly,
Disguise it completely
And end all my lines with an adverb.

He's never forlorn or deterred;
He truly stands out from the herd.
You can't take him lightly;
He's unique, burning brightly,
Like the phoenix (Arabian bird).

See this weapon — my carry? Be chary —
With revolver displayed, I am scary!
It sits in my holster,
My courage to bolster
When things as a bouncer get hairy.

There are things we can feel and not say
Because only the heart knows the way.
It's the rush, it's the glow
When we suddenly know.
It's the brush of the truth when we pray.

Alluringly, Potiphar's missus
Would wink at the lad and blow kisses,
But when he said, "No!"
Off to prison went Joe,
Thinking, "Fine case for abstinence this is."

It's not useful for making guitars,
Or for cars, or for jars, or for spars.
Do not shriek, my dear reader—
I speak of the cedar
That's used for a box of cigars.

My darling one, how can you go?
How ever I'll cope, I don't know.
Oh please do not leave me!
That'll surely aggrieve me,
By which I mean cause me great woe.

What strange genius first opened a chicken,
And then, finding the guts finger-lickin',
Took them out of the bird
(Which may seem quite absurd)
And with giblets made gravy to thicken?

From his cattail perch, red-winged and strong,
Sings a blackbird, who'll show before long
The bright source of his name—
Epaulets flashing flame.
"Oak-a-lee!" Hear the cheer in that song.

When our city was under attack,
We built walls and installed heavy flak.
All this fortifying went
Just as well as we'd meant,
And the enemy never came back.

Now you hurt me too much, so screw you.
You used me to dump on,
An' now you would jump on
My bones? Well, excuse me, we're through.

Aulophobia's fear of the flute;
I've a case that's severe and acute.
Just the thought makes me cringe,
But I really unhinge
And go ape at the very first toot.

In this city, my uncle is mayor.
My aunt is D. Trump's chief purveyor,
But my cousin's a brawler,
A battler, a mauler;
They refer to him as an "affrayer."

Though his S.A.T. scores all had caved,
Your son's path to the Ivies was paved.
It'll cost you X grand
To admit.  It's the land
Of the "G" and the home of the waived.

At a marvellous party in Tonga
We ended by dancing the conga,
With the whole population
In concatenation:
The line couldn't get any longer!

"There's a rumor I heard that you're blue,
So I've come here to cheerfulize you."
Just my use of that word,
Since it sounds so absurd,
Brought a smile, so I bowed and withdrew.

Through the ages, all cultures erect
Tall buildings to show their respect —
Like a citadel, Chartres,
Tour Eiffel (that's high art)!
We are all business now, I suspect.

The brute strode toward our coach with a swagger,
And my pistol-shots just made him stagger.
Now my dags both were spent,
So I dropped them and went
For my rapier and damascened dagger.

Aides-mémoire are a way to restore.
You won't have to think twice,
With some note or device.
It's French. I've forgotten what for.

The cowpea is grown as manure
By those for whom cow poo's impure.
If cows instead eat 'em
And loudly excrete 'em,
It's peasy to follow their spoor.

If they're stored in a cool box— a chest
You can buy at small price
And then fill up with ice.
Yours is sheathed in gold plate? I'm impressed!

Budget busting is Congress's game.
Now we've deficits no one can tame.
All their spending on end

When you step into traffic
On painted lines graphic,
Cars approaching will stop on a dime.

Like humans and chipmunks and camels)
There's a surface of white
On each tooth—shiny, bright.
Teeth are covered with dental enamels.

But, when moved, it can cause quite a shock.
Crawly bugs make me squirm,
Whether insect or worm,
And I hate to be near where they flock.

Whether naturally found or synthetic.
When your love says, "We're through!"
Agglutinant goo
Can't hold her (now don't be pathetic).

Was so deadening having to hear it,
Yet in visceral ways
I am missing those days
Back when W.'s drawl crushed my spirit.

A fraud is a small hairless cat,
And it feeds on the blind cueva rat.
They both live underground
Where zoologists found
That this cat's blessed with ears like a bat.

New decitabine treats MDS
(In which bone marrow cells are a mess).
Though a possible cure
Has seductive allure,
Your destruction will likely progress.

Of modern SF, the real founding
Is imputed to Campbell's Astounding;
For decades John taught,
By each story he bought,
The importance of factual grounding.

Canary seed? Really? How sweet!
To grow one, thought I, would be neat;
But nobody told me
The seed that they sold me
Was stuff for the creatures to eat.

"If you want a successful career
In fast food, be on time!  Is that clear?
In at six.  When you're done,
Leave precisely at one.
To this schedule, you'll have to adhere."

See a goal as a target to set,
Like the rise you've put hours in to get,
Or the kick, flagging your
Prime intention to score,
That then slammed the ball into the net.

Your start in the world is a mess,
But you don't have to wallow in stress.
Though you're left on your own,
By your efforts alone
You can bootstrap yourself to success.

I'm innocent, yet I am blamed.
It is obvious that I was framed.
One unnamed, with a sneeze,
Spilled his ale on the keys
Of the grand, and then left them englaimed.

Threepence halfpenny is all that's left, lads.
With no money for food,

But mosquitos conspire and plot.
With intent to consume ya,

How e'er it gets there.
The piliferous don't want theirs mauled.

And pursued Erwin Rommel's command.
The great Desert Rats corps
Of the Second World War
Garnered fame in the few years it spanned.

You must buy by the ton
For your family of three-hundred-four.

(Less painful than gut celioscopy).
It's a simple procedure
You someday may need—yer
Whole cervix surveyed by colposcopy.

The Bard's bawdy leaps out from his page:
Sexy content adored in his age.
It delighted the crowd;
Words were double-endowed,
Acted broadly and lewdly on stage.

In Spain, at a bullfight, José
Bought a drink at a ringside café.
Not some booze or that ilk—
It was coffee and milk,
Known by locals as Café Olé.

All naked in Eden they grinned,
Eve and Adam, their innocence twinned.
Then the death angel hovered —
With fig leaves they covered.
Our foliaged forefathers sinned.

For their honour, and neither would bend.
Each strove for the blow
That would finish his foe.

Some will claim that it's all in the brain:
Is my brain in my fingers?
Their agony lingers—
My knuckles are going insane.

Whenever publicity's needed,
O'Donnell and Trump seem to feed it
By starting a feud
With each other. How rude!
To both I can only say, "Beat it!"

How to spit like a sailor and turn
That huge vessel to port;
There, you'll find there's no short-
age of hookers just itching to earn.

On the stage, he spoke rather emphatically,
And postured and gestured dramatically.
While appearing intense,
He was making no sense.
Once again, he was thinking erratically.

In my hand is your favor, my sweet,
And, good Lord, is your handwriting neat!
(For worse or for better,
Once favor meant "letter,"
The kind that's become obsolete.)

The cider last autumn was sweet,
And the way that we made it was neat:
We took apples uphill
To the old cider mill.
They were squeezed in a press. What a treat!

To depression the down quark is prone,
Since it can't call its proton its own.
It has  two lighter quarks
Making uppish remarks,
Both refusing to leave it alone.

Bibliophily? Philly will lure you
With libraries bound to ensure you
Can read all the writing,
Both dull and exciting,
Librarians ably procure you.

The full orchestra isn't arrayed
To perform Strauss's fine serenade.
With some strings and four horns—
Woodwinds, too—it adorns
Every symphony hall where it's played.

Though I covet a lady's affection,
My build isn't up to inspection.
Thus I'll work on my abs,
'Cause this god-awful flab's
So disgusting I'm deep in abjection.

As we gathered for matters baptismal
The atmosphere seemed quite abysmal.
I think it was maybe
That Rosemary's baby
Had decided to make it damn dismal.

F: The fourth note on the scale.
Fa: How that note you might hail.
Fad: Passing fancy.
Fade: Seeing's chancy.
Fader: Loud volume curtail.

I'm contemptible.  Yes, and I'm base.
I'm quarrelsome, right in your face.
I'm currish — prefer
To behave like a cur —
Lift my leg on the whole human race.

What a wimp of a word!  But y'know,
Also changed from its old status quo.
Now just "too" or "as well,"
Once its strength could compel:
Even thus, in such wise, wholly so.

Consideration's not too much to ask:
Don't you think you might help with the task
Of arranging this thing
With my arm in a sling?
Think of me while you selfishly bask.

Fertilization will follow, when fated,
After couplings divinely x-rated:
The old egg-and-the-sperm thing,
The dead-bunnies-confirm thing.
Expecting, for most, means "elated."

Did you see that old movie, Algiers?
The Frenchman and Hedy in tears?
"To the Casbah please take me
And never forsake me"—
Such words linger on through the years.

My design for her fabric was floral.
Crested coral roots, though, made her quarrel.
The colors were mellow,
Both brownish and yellow,
But my client found orchids immoral.

You've a liver? It's pumping out bile.
And your other parts? Ichors most vile.
	But the lymph mixed with fat—
	You ain't got none of that?
You're achylous, bud: lacking in chyle.

Dioristic? Distinctive, defining,
Like my eyes when they're edged with bright lining:
I use ocher and puce
And squeezed-beetles' green juice.
(The last when I'm out for fine dining.)

My cousin, who lives in Khartoum,
Is with child—so the neighbors presume—
But there's pain, so she screams,
And her pregnancy seems
Extrauterine: outside the womb.

What I write's like the art known as Dada.
Making sense just gets harder and harder,
And the lines of my ballad
Are a crazy word-salad.
Tra-la-lee! Tra-la-la! Yada-yada!

Poor southerners, if they are white,
Are called crackers by some. That's not right!
(This is just the US.
Southern France, I would guess,
Has its own terms for starting a fight.)

He bats from both sides of the plate,
Swinging lefty and righty of late.
He's a slugger with wood,
And he wishes he could
Get some balls down the middle and straight.

I know a young scoundrel from Hove,
Who is such a dislikeable cove.
His manner is mean.
He's as sour, at sixteen,
As the lemons that grow in the grove.

All they got, Cold Bath convicts, for fuel
At breakfast was worse than thin gruel:
Bread steeped in boiled water —
Bum-charter.  There oughta
Be laws against treatment that cruel.

He's inventive beyond comprehension;
Every outfit sings out for attention.
His choice in costumery's
Brilliant with humor; he's
Broken the bonds of convention.

That religious indifference you see
Is acedia; call it ennui,
Call it apathy, boredom
Or sloth.  (I've ignored Him.)
Whatever you do, don't call me.

When I see that our rules have been breached
And my sermon on evil's been preached—
Don't stand in my way,
I've got demons to slay—
For my boiling point's finally been reached.

A cycle's a round, or a course
Of successive events, like divorce
And remarriage of stars,
Or exchange of one's cars.
(But not periodic by force.)

There's a colorless, volatile juice
That's forbidden for underage use.
You can drink alcohol
Without any withdrawal,
But it won't respond well to abuse.

Crying uncle? It means you surrender—
Give in to a stronger contender,
But the term's also found
When we're kidding around
With a friend of the opposite gender.

The chink of our finished-with plates
Is a sound that our canine equates
With the chink of, perhaps,
Metal bowls filled with scraps.
Optimistic, she eagerly waits.

At his lecture, I felt a voyeur,
As he taught the reverse of Pasteur.
It's the Crabtree effect,
And it will, I suspect,
Earn a lesser degree of grandeur.

Pinot grapes should make wine richly red!
These pale things have poor color; instead,
I'll press off the skins
'Ere fermenting begins —
Blanc de noirs ain't a wine we should dread.

An Author's Note: words to be heeded,
But a few words are all that is needed.
If an Author's Note's long,
Well then, something's gone wrong,
And the piece simply hasn't succeeded.

"Simple" Murphy, that ding-dong, sneered, "Right!
A bell's peal is a ding-dong? Not quite!
I've heard that one before
From your mother, the whore,"
So we had us a wild, ding-dong fight.

My hopes for C-minus had faded;
My teacher would not be persuaded.
Then she called me a fool,
Nearly flunking in school—
I'm derided, debased and degraded.

In greenhouses, you'll find a room
Where petunias and daffodils bloom.
Floriculture is found
There, with plants all around,
All with flowers.  The scent of perfume!

What's the drink that James Bond used to toast?
In films in the scenes we saw most,
Martinis were favored,
But in novels he savored
Many potables. Hint: there's a host.

The return of our dead is the aim
With this ghost dance, to also reclaim
Our traditions and make
The white colonists take
A trip back to the lands whence they came.

While my usual drone's homiletic,
Over CCD's buzz, it's frenetic!
For the plight of the humble
Bee's causing my grumble.
Please? People, don't bee apithetic.

When I leaned on my new drop-leaf table,
I exceeded the weight it was able
To support with its leaf,
So its hinge came to grief,
Thus exposing a small warning label.

I heard from a friend in Japan
When his biblical studies began:
"I am not libertarian,
But antilapsarian,
Denying that first fall of man."

Each ailment's a sign that I'm buying
Some time. Every cough is fate trying
To kill me; each breath
Simply signals my death.
Hypochondriac? Think that I'm lying?

Old Dan was our station's Dalmatian.
Recalling his first conflagration,
As the flames billowed higher
He hosed down the fire
With the tool used for dog urination.

Based on hype, advertising and spin,
Dermabrasion—removal of skin—
Leaves you scabby and red;
But, once healed, it is said,
You will love the new face that you're in.

First I'm happy with nary a care,
Then I sit all depressed in my lair.
  For a day, life is great,
  Then I sleep six months straight;
You could say I'm a bipolar bear.

As the fetus develops, its forebrain
Is the part of that wonders-in-store brain
That someday will think,
Make a blink, take a drink.
It's the front, and behind it is more brain.

On adnexa the word books play tricks.
It's "subordinate body parts"? Nix!
What's subordinate, then?
From the viewpoint of men
It means all parts except for their pr...ivates.

He blames Lois: a face-saving ploy—
One that only his foes can enjoy.
His integrity's shot,
And his word don't mean squat.
He's seemed lost since he left Illinois.

"Your  Great Dane's," she said, "covered with lice—
Epizoic, and not very nice."
I replied, "Epizoic
Makes his bugs sound heroic,
While lousy, I think, should suffice."

The first to the finish gets laid!
The stupidest bet ever made,
But that agonism meant
My last chance for consent:
The following day I was spayed.

Long strips of potato, deep-fried:
In the States, they're called French fries, but bide…
In Great Britain, they're chips,
Which will cause angry yips
When a tourist and menu collide.

When a damaging frost takes its toll,
Your cotton won't open in whole.
A bolly it's called,
When your boll remains balled,
As is cotton that's ginned from this boll.

Stockcar Dan is a dust-eatin' guy.
Coniophagia's the sad reason why.
Other drivers have seen
What this sickness can mean:
When they say "Eat my dust!" he'll comply.

The Bible — it starts with the Word,
Then recounts loads of stuff that occurred.
And then Jesus was born,
Did His thing and was gorn.
And He hasn't returned — I'd have heard.

I love Carmen, composed by Bizet;
It's a masterful work. Though he may
Have passed on without knowing,
This story keeps glowing
With passion and drama. Olé!

In anthropopathism, maybe you'll find
Fish that love, or some dogs of sound mind.
It's when we ascribe
To the animal tribe
A feeling we find in our kind.

Carpocratians, as Gnostics, contended
The Law was completely transcended,
And so the displays
Of their libertine ways
Were not only okay; they were splendid.

Though apocryphal tales may be lawful,
Statements false, under oath, are just awful.
Unequivocal proof
Of the value of spoof —
What we all need today's a guffawful.

A psychic was jailed on a charge
Of attempting to blow up a barge.
Less than five feet in height,
He escaped in the night.
Screamed the headlines: "Small Medium at Large!"

Dressing warmly, prepared for the frost,
We three kittens the polar line crossed.
We were feeling no chill,
Dearest Mother, until
Our prized arcticized mittens we lost.

I've spotted a pale spotted perch:
It's a fish I've no wish to besmirch.
I'd have shown you my brasse
In biology class,
But I ate it for further research.

She's not a purveyor of panties;
Nor the neighbor next door to your auntie's.
"Mrs. Calabash" came
To be famous; her name
Was a signature — Jimmy Durante's.

What's up with the Friday face, Matt?
You sure look like you just lost your cat.
There's no need be sad—
Skipping meat ain't so bad,
And the weekend is near, so there's that.

Cherimoyas and sweetsops were two
Of the fruits that West Indians grew.
Annonaceous and sweet,
They were scrumptious to eat.
Were they fed to Columbus's crew?

Copulation's my lifelong obsession,
So sleep's but a squandered digression.
In the words of my ex,
"God knows you love sex."
(If God knows, then I'm skipping confession.)

Al Martino first topped the pop chart
With a ballad called "Here in My Heart".
He remained number one
In a nine-week-long run.
For a singer, that's not a bad start.

So you think it was coyness that sent
Me abroad? No, dear Andy, I went
To escape from the curse
Of your verse — it's perverse,
Too persistent, too needy, and bent.

Magna Carta, that seminal pact,
Is a treasured historical fact.
But for lovers of wordplay
(This is quite an absurd play),
It's the 1215 Anagram Act!

"British toilets, we're sorry to say,
Are too frequently barely OK.
To the world they are not
Number one.  Stop the rot!"
Say the folks of the proud BTA.

These leaf pairs are fused: They're connate.
They are joined at their base. It's their fate
On this coral-flowered vine
To forever combine
In their beauty—an eye-catching trait.

Not a boarding school boarder per se:
He's a day boy, i.e., doesn't stay.
Foulest weather en route
Can't deter his commute,
Says his chauffeur, who drives him each day.

At Buckingham Palace the queen
Lives in luxury, as may be seen
By the number of guards
And horses, and yards
And yards of red carpet: all clean!

You look sad; circus work brings you down.
Such dispiritedness makes us all frown.
I'm so mad, I could shake you
To wake you and make you
Aware what's at stake, you damned clown.

In India, visiting Delhi,
I ate curry, and got Delhi belly.
My sickness was dire
And my rear was on fire—
My dire rear was bright yellow, and smelly.

As I wake up each morning in bed,
I consider the world and see red.
Days go downhill from morning,
So I heed my own warning:
Pull the bedclothes back over my head.

So raise up your glasses and cheer
For the wonderful drink that is beer.
Just ignore wine's false voice —
Beer's the real people's choice
And it's beer that we all should revere.

I've got all duded-up for the dance —
Stylish scarf, stockings, shoes. At a glance
It is clear I'll impress
All the guys in this dress,
And the other girls won't stand a chance.

Exhibition games give me a thrill.
I can't wait to see who's on the hill.
Who will pitch for the Mets,
Phenom rookies or vets?
When the season starts, who'll fill the bill?

You've heard bluebird's a color? That's true!
It's described as a moderate hue.
I've learned copen is brighter,
And Dresden is lighter,
But each is a fine shade of blue.

I swear I'm not lying, by God.
If my stomach you happen to prod,
I may feel it instead
At the back of my head.
Truly, allachesthesia's odd.

Does your wonderful bundle of . . . boy . . .
Do his best, as you've guessed, to annoy?
Like that jar of strained peas
That he managed to squeeze
In his cheeks, and now seeks to deploy!

Here's a word that I bet you can guess:
D-A-N-C-E-R-E-S-S.
Have you figured the answer?
That's right: "female dancer."
Your intellect's bound to impress.

"To agitate body or limb";
Not to exercise as in the gym,
But to move about restlessly:
Frig means to zestlessly
Fidget — that won't keep you slim.

I thought I'd play Hamlet, the day
I auditioned to be in the play;
But I'm Osric and I
Must, in playing him, try
To be foppish, beribboned, and fey.

Anadiplosis is when —
When a word is repeated again,
Again for effect,
Effect we expect,
Expect from a slip of the pen.

What an insult (It's grand! It's majestic!)
For consumers of cheese non-domestic
Who, in wartime, show fear.
I'd include the term here,
But I can't since it's non-anapestic.

The cheerleader flips down the field.
All of those in her way better yield!
She cartwheels so fast
She's here, now she's past,
You can't see that her tummy's revealed!

Carolean refers to the rule
Of two Charleses of England. One fool
Was a tyrant, which led
To his losing his head,
While the other thought Catholics were cool.

Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice,
Shame on me.  Fool me ten times?  Not nice.
Shoulda known you'd repeat
Your behavior and cheat.
My fool's paradise came at a price.

Her work was inspired by Dante
And the words of Lorenzo Da Ponte.
She wordlessly found
An equivalent sound
In her new and profound concertante.

He's collapsed, and can't budge—not a fraction,
Cataplectic defines the reaction.
He's just seen her. It's her!
She's come back; he can't stir—
Till a part of him springs into action.

At a bar on the Western frontier,
A young termite had wanted a beer.
 He had been on a search
 For a taste of the birch,
So he asked, "Is the bartender here?"

The BCCI gets our plaudits
For flaming farragos of fraud; its
"20-billion-plus heist"
Saw depositors iced,
And disgrace for the firms doing audits.

The BC is a church of great piety,
Called "Tunkers" in old-time society,
With Wesleyan roots
And peaceful pursuits.
They are models of Christian propriety.

A censor is one of the guys
Whom all of  the writers despise.
When he edits the "smut"
Half their good stuff is cut—
And their chance for a Pulitzer Prize.

Making coffee, then adding this fake
By mistake may result in a break
In my faith in good taste:
Coffee creamer is based
On some stuff that I'd rather not take.

The Bvumba, the "Mountains of Mist",
On Zimbabwe's east border, consist
Of granitic terrain
With a dolerite vein:
Essentially, that's the whole list.

When the 50 Foot Woman attacks,
You'll need popcorn and sodas and snacks.
See the giantess doom
Her philandering groom!
See the absence of 30-foot slacks!

Borborygmus, herewith we apprize:
A gas bubble sound breeding denies.
You can't manage to squelch
When it's fated to belch
Or, worse yet, to escape twixt your thighs.

If this matters, there's gossip about
Dolly Varden: she's not a true trout.
She's a salmon, a dream
Off the grill, or in cream,
Then washed down with a cold Guinness stout.

Amputees, bodies broken and maimed,
Missing limbs hidden landmines have claimed…
Blame the warmongers' game
For the crippled and lame,
And the dead yet unnumbered, unnamed.

In an automat (self-serve café),
Much cuisine can be seen on display.
Make your choice, then guess what?
Drop your coin down the slot.
There's your chow!  Eat it now! On your way!

When Moroccans make amlou, they grind
Roasted almonds with honey, combined
With argan nut oil.
One taste, you're disloyal
To peanutty spreads, but won't mind.

A goldsmith puts gold in his pot,
Called a cruset, and waits till it's hot.
Once it's liquid, he'll pour
A few ounces or more
In a mold that will hold what he's got.

What's a child of a chink and a honky?
Mate the words and you come up with chonky.
If you're likely to dis
Using language like this,
You're a word that can also mean donkey.

Decortication? For that, dad had zeal.
At the end of a family meal
He indulged his pursuit,
Which was skinning round fruit —
He could do it in one spiral peel.

Spiro Keats, as a bushranging stranger,
Roamed the Outback just searching for danger.
Like an outlaw of old,
He was grizzled and cold
And one hell of a home-on-the-ranger.

The advance party raced on ahead,
To forestall any problems, they said.
When we got there—how rude!—
They had scarfed all the food
And neglected to save me a bed.

In a factory, cost center means
A department or group of machines
Viewed as cost-factor units
And used to fine-tune its
Production of autos or jeans.

In a club meant for those who love arts
And handicrafts, working from charts
At embroidery or knitting,
One faction is quitting:
A contingent of fumbling old farts.

A book on Baroque (which is mine)
Lists these buildings exceedingly fine:
Radcliffe Camera and
St. Mary-le-Strand,
Both erected to Gibbs's design.

She was born with long hair to her thigh,
And large breasts for a newborn, say I.
On a seashell she's seen
Looking more like nineteen,
As two angels are blowing her dry.

To Lucille, helping junkies appealed;
Many hundreds she treated and healed.
Seems her clinic's predominance
Owes a lot to her prominence—
The eminency gained in her field.

My family, always close-knit,
Now are fighting and fixing to split.
Mom and Dad can't agree;
Both are angry at me—
But I don't care a whit, I admit.

In mid-ocean, I spotted some dry land,
But this atoll looked nothing like my land.
It looked, from my raft,
Like a sundial's shaft—
It appears that that gnomon's an island.

While the artwork's not overly pretty,
And the dialog's not all that witty,
Bobby Make-Believe's fame
Can be guessed by his name:
He's pre-Thurber, a child Walter Mitty.

Cro-Magnons were cave-dwellers who
Looked like me and potentially you,
With a prominent chin,
Rising forehead, and thin,
Gracile figure—that's me, through and through.

Some are hooked on their drugs, but this site
Has addicted me. My tragic plight
Keeps my eyes on the screen.
Go for walks? I'm not keen
On that plan. On my life there's a blight.

For a day truly perfect (an A day)
I send up a bathroom-break Mayday:
Please install a bidet
In my potty. You say
I should buy me a bidet on payday.

My English professor was amicable
Until I changed "grammar" to "grammicable"
In my composition:
His warm disposition
Soon waned, and I failed my examicable.

The targets weren't easy to see
As the rifle-range baffles, all three,
Seemed to get in the way
And my shots went astray.
Dunno why, it's just baffling me.

André Roussimoff once was my client.
On my counsel, this man was reliant:
"You want fortune and fame?
First you drop that last name.
From now on, you are 'Andre the Giant.'"

Seems his flock is attempting to block
The new bishop's intent to defrock
Father Rocco—who made
Some mistakes, but has paid
For his sins. It's a terrible shock!

This website's deliciously strewn
With our verses — not quite all in tune,
So we'll beaver away
Through the night and the day,
And they'll all read like dreams pretty soon.

Our municipal swim club's exclusive—
Men only. Its members, collusive,
Have joined in a plot
That's illegal. They'll not
Admit women. The plan is abusive.

From the room of my teenager comes
A continuous pounding on drums.
It's a steady redounding
And constant resounding—
Thank god that its ceaselessness numbs!

A fashion-monger, Poppa's a fop.
In his wardrobe, he's over-the-top.
To be fully in fashion
Is our dandy-dad's passion.
We call him our "popinjay pop."

En français, mon chéri (parlez-vous?),
When there's many a thing, there's beaucoup.
From that language Romantic
It crossed the Atlantic.
We use it in English now, too.

In the woodlands, we've had many hikes
Passing bristle grass: large, arching spikes
And long bristles below.
I took photos and show
Them on Facebook.  They've got 20 "Likes."

Dishabille and still reeking of gin,
She raced out to the curb with her bin.
"Am I late for the trash?"
The man grinned in a flash:
"Not at all, lady.  Hop right on in!"

The gambler, brow knit in a frown,
Watched his faro chip assets go down.
"This is rigged, so they say,
But I still have to play.
It's the only game left in this town."

She is super- (sweet) cali- (divine)
fragilistic- (cute) expi- (so fine)
alidocious. What's more,
She's inclined to adore
These ridiculous limericks of mine.

If freezing cold winds weren't enough,
For emperor penguins life's rough.
After months out at sea,
The She swaps with the He:
Egg-care handover parents find tough.

After months, it is hard to let go,
As the penguins both love their egg so.
In Antarctica's chill
There's a way, but the will
To hand over can make the task slow.

What's clayware? Ceramics from clay,
Kept hot in a kiln for a day —
Or sometimes for longer,
To make the things stronger
So they last well and do not decay.

Take the outermost edge of a book
(Not a Kindle, or Kobo, or Nook).
You'll find bookbinders grace
That fore-edge (or face)
At times with gold leaf, if you look.

Two new painkillers: Bayer had reckoned
That the first had a future that beckoned.
Diamorphine became
An exceptional shame;
They got riches and fame from the second.

Getting shot in the foot, they're the gang
That can't shoot straight.  They don't have the hang
Of things yet.  It's not one
Or two things that they've done
That's a mess; it's the whole big shebang.

While newly engaged on a jaw full
Of concepts for limericks awful,
The betrothed dental nurse
Said, "It's surely a curse
To be given a whole bottom drawerful."

Did a barm brewer brew lots of barm?
Did this stuff ever cause people harm?
No, not really, at least
Not directly. It's yeast.
There's a job with an old-timey charm.

Oh, give me a chicken leg dish.
It's nicer than red meat or fish.
Then, just leave me alone,
To eat down to the bone,
Though it's useless for making a wish.

I adored Grandpa Dan's one-man band:
Harp and zither, one plucked with each hand,
Drums and bells played by toes,
A kazoo with his nose—
He did Mozart and Bach on command.

A boy on my sidewalk in Yonkers
Would smash all the other boys' conkers
With only one chestnut.
We called him "the best nut"
Because he was totally bonkers.

Where animals breed, live and die
Can be tracked, but his question is "Why?"
Land, grazing and weather
He'll study together,
That biogeography guy!

What a fire-breathing speaker was Tanner:
Aggressive in speech, tone, and manner.
So her club, "Please Stay Calm,"
Which promotes words of balm,
For draconic speech voted to ban her.

Customariness can't be assumed;
What a sorry mess might be presumed.
If you want to guess how,
See our youth obsess: NOW!
Ask for any less? Normalcy's doomed.

The dadblasted deer, dressed and neat,
Was laid out for Dad's cookout, complete.
But the grill at the fling
Got too hot—dadblamed thing—
And we all had to eat dadburned meat.

That player of baseball, Ty Cobb,
Was esteemed and adored by the mob.
Said President Taft,
Who admired his craft,
"Ty, you're doing a heck of a job!"

Demonolatry—that's when you pray
In a very unorthodox way,
And your worship's directed
Not at God, as expected,
But a devil (and thus led astray).

The city of Canton's a joke,
With a stench that's so foul you could choke.
Folks there say, to be funny,
"It smells just like money."
If that's true, I would rather be broke!

I've the gift of the gab: I talk fab.
At debate I'm a hand that is dab.
Dunno why, when I preach,
As I gab, people screech,
"Cease your speech and siddown! Shut your gab!"

It is useless, you know, to pretend
That its damage you're going to mend,
For that moth-eaten chair
Is beyond all repair.
You are flogging a dead horse, my friend!

Close of day: I collapse into bed
And old terrors take over my head.
Dreams of sleep clearly gone,
I await the next dawn.
Light sustains me; it's nightfall I dread.

They who knew I could rhyme all these words
Say you boo my "Should slime call cheese 'curds'?"
Your non-feigned slighting shows
More constrained writing foes
May pooh-pooh "Why would lime stall fleas' turds?"

Change a slum to a middle-class zone,
Which as gentrification is known,
By improving the lot
Of each low-status spot.
The whole district soon rises in tone.

His assertion was strong as could be.
"I'm convinced that on this you'll agree:
Asseverative is
A good word for a quiz,
But it certainly can't describe me."

Nutted corn flakes, bananaed her pie,
Gravied biscuits without  saying why.
As a cook she's reclusive,
Inventing intrusive
New verbs for her dishes—so sly.

Roller coasters are thrilling, I find.
I go up, I zoom down, and I wind
All around; but the highs
And the lows I despise
Are my yo-yo, emotional kind.

I'm a thoroughly Darwinist guy.
It's survival by fitness, I cry.
Variation's the means —
Chance changes our genes.
The creationists?  Pie in the sky.

Fly Agaric: a toadstool. Just look,
Don't touch it! — it's not one to cook.
You'll spot more if you search
Near each tall silver birch:
Red and white, from a child's picture book!

Diplomatic and suave, she's a charmer.
Rude words just bounce off — they don't harm 'er.
Their domage is trivial,
So she's convivial,
Clothed in emotional armor.

Old Akko, along Acre Bay,
Where once did the Canaanites stay,
Changed hands through the ages
Of history's pages.
The city's Israeli today.

Near the mousehole old Pusscat would wait
For the mousie to come for the bait—
A chunk of aged Cheddar;
But mousie knew better,
Thus foiling a fat-feline fate.

Continuous positive pressure
On my airway is such a refresher.
Sleep apnea's gone,
So I wake up at dawn
And don't feel I've been drawn though a thresher.

There's a speeder called Leadfooted Rose:
She bears down on the gas — off she goes!
While the others drive slow,
Her insane "Go, go, GO!"
Keeps the highway patrol on its toes.

Once a pocketbook (held in the coat)
Or a basket or purse folks would tote,
There was plenty of room in all
Forms of the crumenal,
A handbag for times more remote.

I was conked in a sudden attack,
Knocked out cold with the force of the smack.
But I wasn't quite dead;
In a hospital bed…
There my conscious awareness came back.

"Will you book me a cab?" asks the guy.
"A taxicab, sir? I will try."
Then the guy says to me,
"And how long will it be?"
"Nearly thirteen foot six," I reply.

The cardinal directions are four.
In the morning you see the sun soar
From the East, then go West.
North and South are the rest.
Now relax! There will never be more.

At the 3-D Shapes' Speed Dating Fest,
I am charmed by a girl who's possessed
Of a circular section
And tube-like perfection.
For now, she's cylindrically dressed.

When All in the Family debuted,
Many critics thought Archie too rude.
They may have been right,
But each Saturday night,
Right in front of our sets we were glued.

"My careful research and analysis
Has found that a facial paralysis
Is often Bell's palsy,"
Declared Dr. Halsey.
"Use steroids, but never dialysis."

As she buzzed through a breezy bazaar,
Busy Bee said, "My bezzies, by far,
Are my sisters, the workers.
They've never been shirkers,
Like drones. We're best friends — yes, we are."

Legs parted, our model is dozing.
Look! Her sexual parts she's exposing.
Bring a wrap for this chick—
Some envelopment—quick,
'Cause her privates could stand some enclosing.

Though the party is only just starting,
Our eyes are now visibly smarting.
And the source of the smell,
As  those here know full well,
Is your father. He never stops farting.

She had said I was handsome and funny,
Started calling me "sweetheart" and "honey".
Then one day I caught on:
It had all been a con!
She beglamoured me — then stole my money.

Bea could never see birthdays with glee.
A comparable outlook might be
Harold's holiday gloom
Over Christmas.  No room
For the bright side discourages me.

Chronologic events are arranged
In a timeline: at first we exchanged
Our numbers, then dated,
Engaged, became mated,
Fought once — now we're sadly estranged.

I was born with three legs, and I drink
Since I'm not the success you might think.
No, the fact I'm an oddity
Just prompts discommodity:
When I try to play soccer, I stink.

When a pair holds dissimilar views
About marriage, a conflict ensues.
Alice wants to wed Marc;
Marc thinks life is a lark.
She hears wedding bells. He hears kazoos.

As they waited, Moe mentioned, "I miss
An old song that went something like this:
La-da-dee, la-da-dum,
La-de-dah, bum-bum-bum."
"Moe, you jerk, that's Wayne Cochran's 'Last Kiss'."

Of Hellenic peninsulas three,
The most easterly's known as Akti.
Macedonia's friend,
It's Chalcidice's end,
Where the monks say their prayers by the sea.

What a thrill! I've been bashed in a tweet
By the Prez! Now my life-goal's complete.
That the Donald feels I
Am a threat is now my
Badge of honor. I cry, "Oh, how sweet!"

"That won't fit any jock in our stock,"
Said the prissy young salesgirl, in shock.
"Not a lot I can do—
It's too cockeyed—askew.
Try the sporting goods store, down the block."

When my car quit on Route 98
I decided it must have been fate:
With no call box in sight
In the darkness of night,
'Twas the first time I'd had a blind date!

We work hard:  I, Roseanne and Mercedes.
After work, we'll imbibe at Bar Hades.
We three chicks come alive
When the bell rings at five;
I'll yell, "Time for a drinkypoo, ladies!"

Rush Limbaugh's a strict doctrinaire,
A conservative loaded for bear.
So don't try to sway him
(Or ever outweigh him).
He'll simply go off on a tear.

I'm a kook, nearly all will agree.
But my past is my benchmark, you see,
And I'm always this strange.
Thus, there hasn't been change
From my baseline.  Weird's normal for me.

Round the edge of a coin are reliefs,
Called engrailment, to thwart any thief's
Inclination to trim
Precious bits off the rim.
There are reasons for grooves and motifs.

I'm writing my ex an epistle
(A letter that's formal). Yeah, this'll
Be leaving no doubt
That I'm kicking her out.
She won't cook so I've signed her dismissal.

When the boss issued disinformation,
Our whole workforce expressed detestation—
That's abhorrence and loathing—
For this wolf in wolf's clothing
Who delights in his staff's consternation.

Drat those cutworms!  They're wasteful and brutal,
Nipping right through the stem, so the root'll
Just die.  It's so needling
To see my dead seedling
Whose growth spurt has now proven futile.

Ladies saw him and swooned: "He's so dashing!"
And the other men saw their hopes crashing
Like the waves on the shore;
But he's handsome no more—
The result of a jolly good thrashing.

Aurora's a town in Missouri,
Away from the bustle and fury
Of big-city worries,
Where nobody hurries.
The sheriff's the judge and the jury.

What the hell do you think you are doing?
That's tobacco (good Lord!) you are chewing?
I do not want your kisses
Since, Gloria, this is
Disconducive to billing and cooing!

A cobbler decided to stay
In Achille, a town in OK.
As he opened a store,
He sent adverts galore
For "Achille's Heels — Opening Day."

The control tower guys at the field
Tell the planes to proceed or to yield.
It's the law of the land
To obey their command—
Well, at least till the statute's repealed.

Richard Simmons accited the masses
And called them to exercise classes.
His summons was heard,
And some millions were stirred
Just enough to get off of their asses.

The election, eighteen eighty-four,
Featured scandals you couldn't ignore:
James G. Blaine, who knew better,
Invoked "Burn this letter",
Which helped Grover Cleveland to score.

Round his New Model Army he planned;
So King Charles had no chance to withstand.
Warts and all, Cromwell's mission
Ensured the transition
To rule by MPs in the land.

His discipleship? That is to Marx.
Does he follow those Communist sharks
Bent on worldwide disaster?
No, in play with his master,
It's with Groucho, not Karl, the guy larks.

Their emotions ran hot with such haste—
As they fought, second thoughts they soon faced.
Although sorrys were said,
Each was bitter; why wed?
Some words' aftertaste can't be erased.

Though my buddy felt utterly cruddy
About getting my study all muddy,
The response that I chose
Was a blow to the nose.
Now my study's both muddy and bloody.

The asthenosphere really is not
An inviting or welcoming spot,
For it's frightfully deep
('Nuff to make the skin creep)
And the climate's oppressively hot.

To achieve the results I desired,
I studied till thoroughly tired.
Such elucubration
Bore naught but frustration;
I'll rest now until I'm inspired.

God in Heaven, dear Father, I pray
In frustration.  Please show me the way.
I've lost eight thousand bucks,
And my life really sucks.
I should sack Uncle Billy?  OK.

You claim to sell food that's comestible,
That's tasty and also digestible.*
Grandpa left me some shares
In your firm—French Fried Hares,
And I hope the investment's divestible.

When I'm out, my extravagance shows
In my chic ghetto fabulous clothes.
They're flamboyant and gaudy.
I'm tellin' ya, Lawdy,
These duds are a hit with the hos.

In the barn it was pitch dark one night,
When I ruined the candle — no light!
Then the voice of my boss
Made me angry and cross:
"Disappear! Yes, get out of my sight!"

Catalonia's a region in Spain
Where La Liga's new champions train.
Barcelona's the team;
Playing soccer's the dream.
At the Nou Camp these footballers reign.

With battens, a sailor curtails
Saggy leaches of fore-and-aft sails.
The crux of the matter:
Just making them flatter
Works better in zephyrs and gales.

There's a sound that can terrify me:
It's a wasp's and goes 'b-u-z-z',
But a lesson it's taught
When its buzz I cut short
With my swatter — one swipe! RIP!

I met my blind date and I took
Her to dinner.  I fell for her look.
But her statement would throw me—
She said, "You won't know me.
I plan to remain a closed book."

Jacob knew he was in for a passel
Of pain when the Lord said "Let's rassle."
God struck like a rocket,
Pulling hip from its socket.
The lesson: He's Lord, you're His vassal.

Backseat driver, stop torturing me
With annoying advice.  Can't you see
I'm performing a task
On my own?  Did I ask
For your input?  This zone is nag-free.

Our first biological child
Was a breeze, raised with ease, so we smiled;
With the second and third,
Far more problems occurred.
And the twelve we adopted? Plain wild.

When my dad was demobbed, I recall,
There he stood, strangely dressed, in the hall.
No more need to salute
In his civvy street suit.
Soldier gone — father back with us all.

This word came to be, but where from?
Maybe Latin or German or some
Other language. Of course,
Whatever its source,
Its derival is how it's become.

It's not brains that define a go-getter,
Since the cleverest folk can be wetter
Than the foggiest day.
And that leads me to say:
Knowing more doesn't mean knowing better.

Certain foods contain substances that
Can cause hyperactivity: fat
Chance you'll ever sit still
Or be calm! Eat your fill
If excitability's where you are at.

Said a drumbeater (wannabe star):
"My percussion is not up to par,
But with endless devotion
To selfish promotion
I'll certainly go pretty far."

GIS can enable a chap
To present in the form of a map
All the households in France
With a weekend romance
And a subsequent case of the clap.

I once knew a colour-blind fella
Who loved mayonnaise, white or yella.
He never could see
What seemed creepy to me—
So he's dead now, my friend Sal Monella.

This "syndrome": a guy has ignited;
Delirious; hyper-excited;
Lashes out at the cops;
Then goes still, and heart stops.
Cause of death? ExDS is indicted.

Why are there—I've pondered the reason—
Different names for the very same season?
You'd think I'd remember,
Come end of September,
Fall and autumn are equally pleasin'.

My iPod is gone — I'm annoyed.
It fell in a well, down a void.
It's now a deperdit.
Precisely the word, it
Means "that which is lost or destroyed".

"Your library's truly capacious.
It holds oodles of books, and it's spacious,"
Said the egghead's young guest,
"I'm profoundly impressed.
And you've read every one? Goodness gracious!"

Canon Edwards, we're told, quite unwell,
Fell from grace led by demons from hell.
Then the Dean, also told,
Fired the canon. Behold—
The old verger, when told, tolled the bell.

My diabolizing plans will include:
Make the pope appear racist and rude,
A great dope apostolic,
Divorced, alcoholic,
Both sexist and publically lewd.

It's a turnover call (not a foul),
And the fans in the stands start to howl!
Since  both hands touched the ball,
Double dribble's the call,
But the coach disagrees. Hear him growl!

Since you nosed to the magistrates, sir,
We can never be friends as we were.
I confided in thee,
But you gnarled upon me —
Gnarling dog, snarling treacherous cur.

Now my wife is expecting, I've got
A long list that begins baby's cot
And ends, if you please:
University fees.
Seems I'll have to fork out for the lot!

Getting on toward the end of the day,
Almost midnight, the clock ticked away.
"Cinderella, I'm not,
And I like him a lot,"
Terri thought.  She decided to stay.

A train-set designer had dreams
Of constructing two trestles with beams
That would hold his own weight,
But he ate and he ate.
Got too big for his bridges, it seems.

She gazed at me hotly, boudoirally,
Bosom heaving and eyes glowing starrily.
In spite of my virus
She made me desirous.
"Led's ged barried," I offered, catarrhally.

If we give you a lot, we allot
An allotment that's part of the pot
Of what we all share.
We try hard to be fair,
And we hope that you don't think it's squat.

Maximilian, an archducal son,
A Mexican empire'd begun.
His regime got a veto
From Juárez (Benito),
Who led a rebellion, and won.

Distant voices abound in John's ear—
It's the Martians he's sure he can hear.
With a rake raised up high,
He observes the night sky,
And their signal comes in loud and clear.

A drapery maker named Burton
Invented the craftiest curtain—
Even when it's pulled closed,
Naked babes are exposed.
One-way fabric is shady, for certain!

This dance floor was meant to be leapt on
And twirled on and pased on, except on
The day some French lass
Brought her puppy to class.
What a pity when Rover got stepped on.

He uses both cunning and force,
And a very thick lasso, of course;
And his title of "buster
Of broncos" adds luster
To the labor of breaking a horse.

Notre Dame has a very high ceiling,
And the bell tower bells send us reeling.
When they call us to pray,
What is heard miles away
Has a ring to it. Find it appealing?

When his cardiac failure began,
Docs concocted a radical plan.
What they take from an ermine
Will serve to determine
The fate of a stoat-hearted man.

Her man Herman is grieving — that worm.
His pet conger fish caught a bad germ,
And he's made a big deal
Of the death of that eel.
Hear him cry, "Oh dear God, how I erme!"

My mansion could stand a new column;
Just one looks a little too solemn.
I'll say that it's my style
To make my home distyle.
My neighbors?  I want to enthrall 'em.

E.T.  only second? How queer.
Time magazine made it quite clear
That it changed its routine
And acclaimed a machine
In place of its Man of the Year.

Tony Hancock, asked, "Given before?",
Replied, "Well, I once served in the war."
And, to try to impress,
"Given, no, but spilt, yes!
Should a blood donor give any more?"

The judge in a probate court grills
The attorneys, who show off their skills.
The deceased named two heirs,
Each declaring their share's
More than half. It's a battle of wills.

They were married outdoors, 'neath the trees,
Where their awnings and tents caught the breeze.
When she said, with a frown,
"Take the canopies down,"
He came back with a large can of peas.

Distraction? I will not succumb to it.
Derision?  I'll make myself numb to it.
Some want, as our mission,
A shorter edition?
I'll cross that abridged when I come to it!

They would beat him and keep him awake
For a week. His whole body would ache,
But the names in his head
Stayed right there. Now he's dead.
To the end, this brave man did not break.

The Queen of the Suburbs is Ealing;
West-Londoners find it appealing.
The rest of us care
For the studios there,
Which left the world gleefully reeling.

Acquire: to gain, steal or buy.
And I'm finished! Let's chat — shall we try?
I feel great, day's been swell.
How are you — hope you're well?
Oops I'm done! Have to go now! Good-bye!

The grand admiral's not all that grand,
Yet this doddering man's in command
Of the fleet. Why is this?
Other admirals we diss
Because this one has rank, understand?

Who wrote this terrif limerick? Well,
I'm the genius, the author. Oh, hell,
I suppose I'll reveal:
I just borrow or steal
A word here, a line there. (Please don't tell.)

She's lonely, and getting much older,
Still mad from the night when he told her,
"You bitter old crone;
I was better alone!"
And she can't lose that chip on her shoulder.

"We'll abolish conscription forthwith".
Whitlam's words thrilled our hearts to the pith,
And "It's Time!" was the cry
When Gough reached for the sky
Down at Blacktown: the birth of the myth.

I reside with my homie, Bill Mohr.
I'm locked out (left my keys in da drawer).
He's inside ('least I'm hopin').
"Hey dude, would ya open
Da darn domicillary door?"

Two Yalies imbibed in a pub;
Its name was Ye Olde Drinking Club.
When I asked, "Howya feeling?"
They answered me, reeling,
"We've beer cans galore, but no grub!"

A brilliant, bright garnet that's red
Is the almandite.  Legend has said
Garnets lit Noah's ark
And guide wearers through dark.
It's called almandine, sometimes, instead.

DC Comics, for all of their worth,
Are ofttimes the subjects of mirth:
"How few heroes will do
For replacing bulbs? Two—
One for holding, one turning the Earth!"

"To draw intraperitoneal fluid,
What's the old way the books say to do it?"
I'd just read a thesis
On culdocentesis:
"Transvaginal needle."  I knew it!

Douglas Fairbanks was known to disparage
The life-ending sacrament, marriage.
So each time he was groomed,
This proud stallion, he broughammed:
He would promply run off with his carriage.

In court, Enoch Bartlett draws stares
As he glares at the judge and declares,
"I'm extremely distressed
You've denied my request
For a jury comprised of my pears!"

As your alcohol levels increase,
Be sure, while around the police,
Not to howl or to fight
With your neighbors at night.
That's disturbance of (hiccup!) the peace.

As for me, ocean air's eudemonic:
A salve for the soul, a sure tonic.
The littoral breeze
That I find by the seas
Brings relief from malaise that is chronic.

I strongly suspect my new boarder
Has body dysmorphic disorder.
Though he's ripped, Rocky thinks
His physique truly stinks.
Well, the last was an animal hoarder.

Take a frat boy who never did think,
Dull his brain with two decades of drink.
Mix in callow belief:
Our Commander in Chief?
It's appalling how low we can CINC.

Amalthea, huge Jupiter's moon,
Orbits twice for each Earth solar noon.
An asteroid captured,
With Jove she's enraptured.
From Io, now sulphur-bestrewn.

How I've fumed every time that I've heard
That a pun is its own fine "reword"!
Let the punning-devoted
Be drawn and then "quoted"
When letters and sounds become blurred.

Why, you dirty, hornswoggling galoot!
This land's mine, clear from here to the butte.
Any claim jumper tries
To say otherwise lies.
Thieving varmint!  Vamoose or I'll shoot.

Feeling crawlings in spots you can't scratch?
There's a clawscrunt by Ma's rhubarb patch,
Where the kine turn for ease
From the cow-itch and fleas.
That's the stump where your need meets its match.

He's been coddled, indulged… what's the phrase?
That's it: farting through silk all his days—
Loads of money, no soul.
I say, dig him a hole.
Put him under; he's set in his ways.

"We were drunk!  This apology, ponder:
While you staggered off for a wander,
Your boyfriend... Chrissakes!
Well, they say absence makes...
And it's not just my heart that grew fonder."

The city's a rat-race, I've found.
To the outback or backblocks I'm bound.
No one cares I'm a frump
Out beyond the black stump,
And there's plenty of space to go round.

Said a flea to a mite passing by,
"You're an acarus, yes, little guy?"
Joked the mite, "I might be."
Cried the flea, "Bad pun — flee!"
"'Twas contrived," the mite jived, "on the fly."

Though it's not 'cause the method's high tech,
When I'm filling out forms, I'm a wreck.
A hermaphrodite, I'm
Mixed up most of the time,
When the check box says Sex—what to check?

H& in h& on the C&yl& b&st&,
D&y Br&on & M&y R& gr&st&.
W&a's husb&, a b&it,
Is c&id: "Unh& it!
Ab&on your sc&alous h&st&!"

The source of the wife's irritation
Is her husband's extreme dedication
To his poor, helpless mother
(He thinks of none other).
It's time for a trial separation!

Lucinda looks up at me coyly,
Then down at her fine linen doily,
Arrasene on her spool
In a kerosene pool
(Her embroidery's bright, but it's oily).

Anacampserote: that which restores
The lost love of a love one adores.
There's an herb, I have heard,
That gave birth to this word,
But it's found just on mythical shores.

Many good guys appearing on screen,
Black or white, red or yellow, I've seen.
All are heroes (thus "good"),
But I've not understood
Where the Hulk would fit in, since he's green.

Joey Chestnut ate sixty-nine franks
To place him in Nathan's top ranks.
Every Fourth of July
Hot dog eaters all vie
To stuff wieners inside of their tanks.

It's an apple used mostly in pies,
And a tart, but still pleasant, surprise.
But my dad and I savour
The sour, crisp flavour
Of Granny Smith straight, no disguise.

I played the front nine like a pro
(That's hole 1 through hole 9) and then whoa!
On the 10th, broke my putter;
Resolve turned to butter,
Lost aim, lost the match, lost my dough.

George Harrison, out of the blue,
Had a tune in his head he thought new.
Cryptomnesia occurred.
He forgot that he'd heard
"He's So Fine"; it's from this that he drew.

Your fingers relieve my frustration;
I relish your firm digitation.
You scratch, you massage,
And you rub — a barrage
For my nerve-endings' gratification.

Things ad extra by God are revealed
To us humans, but knowledge concealed
From our limited sight
Is ad intra — held tight.
So say those in theology's field.

"I've got belonephobia," said Tony,
"And I swear that my fear isn't phony!"
This odd word, it appears,
Means it's needles he fears.
It just looks like he's scared of baloney.

Here some children learn life is not fair—
Chased by bullies, they find the King's lair.
Aslan helps them to find
One who's losing his mind
As he's kept in a big Silver Chair.

Now the cha-cha, a dance so latino,
Should be shunned if you've drunk too much vino.
Try to sashay with class
And you land on your ass:
My dear wife and I tried it—now we know!

Carpal tunnel (the syndrome), I feared,
Had been making my fingers feel weird,
So without too much urgin'
I went to the surgeon.
He fixed it—it's now disappeared.

It's my boyfriend. Now what does he want?
To go bobsledding up in Vermont?
I'm afraid, if we did,
That the bobsled would skid;
I'd end up on my cahn, so I cahn't.

As we broke down the rotting old door,
"Ventilation," said I, "must be poor.
This dark, musty room
Smells as stale as a tomb.
It is frowsty, of that I am sure."

In Milliways, eating his lunch,
Zaphod Beeblebrox stopped in mid-munch.
"This blue-shifted light
Goes with apple just right;
I always enjoy a Big Crunch."

Consciousness of guilt here abounds!
What this guilty guy said, jury, sounds
Like he's hiding his crime.
This guy needs to serve time —
So convict on the cover-up grounds!

When you know that your plant hates your pet,
Or your cat's planning war on the vet,
Stop that thinking — desist!
'Cause those traits don't exist.
(Now I'm sure Old Man Winter's upset.)

Some police enforce parking with zeal
By a clamped Denver boot on a wheel.
Want your car back in gear?
I'll list three options here:
Cut it off, pay a fee, or appeal.

You're by constables seized, in Belize?
Call your consul responsible, please.
He'll counsel, seek bail,
Cancel cheques, check your mail.
That's why merchants paid consulage (fees).

Rather drunk, Fred was driving his hack
The wrong way down a dark one-way track.
His lament (rather shrill):
"All my efforts were nil—
Must be late, 'cause they're all coming back."

There's a place that you'll go when you're done,
But your stay there will not be much fun.
"Home" is in the site's name,
But so's "funeral". Shame,
There's a guy in a box. You're the one.

A bookmaker rarely forgets
To collect when you're losing your bets.
You find yourself scrambling
To pay for your gambling
While running up wagering debts.

A brake disc's a disc on a wheel
Of a bike or an automobile,
Which the brake pads will grip,
Controlling its slip,
And should slow it down with no squeal.

A counterword's meanings abound,
The result of its getting around.
Take set, for example.
Its entry is ample:
In Webster's, the longest I've found.

Ecumenical Patriarch: He
Is first among equals, so we
Respect his high perch
In the Orthodox Church;
He's the highest of powers that be.

Crib-biting's a terrible vice
Seen in horses; it carries a price.
If your stallion or mare
With arched neck sucks in air,
You might seek some preventive device.

Storing data was always a breeze
On diskettes used with early PCs.
Small-capacity based,
They would soon be replaced
By the product used now—DVDs.

My dad dates a woman who's childish.
Her temperament's sweetish and mildish.
Though he sometimes complains
When she wears Mary Janes,
He prefers her to gals that are wildish.

The term gentlewoman's used to denote
That on Lady Charlotta I dote.
But don't be deceived
By that word. Get me peeved
And I'll knock your damn teeth down your throat!

From these sources my dialect's mixed:
A "patrician plantation" that's fixed
With some words Appalachian,
A wee bit of Cajun,
And Gullah—not easily PIXed.

A professor once wrote in his journal:
"I've the secret of life eviternal.
Don't expect my demise.
You'll receive a surprise:
I stay youthful and vigorous, vernal."

Wilhelmina was willowy, stately;
Her behavior was formal, innately.
Although John was a comer,
She judged him a bummer—
An upstart, a Johnny-come-lately.

They are filing a criminal suit,
Since poor Billy was caught with the loot
And a stick-em-up note,
Which they're sure that he wrote—
Now he's going to jail, the old coot.

Our current obtuse White House resident
Is setting a horrible precedent.
Disagree with his views
And he'll call it "fake news!"
There's just one way to answer: "Fake president!"

The criminative look on your face
Says we caught you. Go on, plead your case.
We all know you did it,
So best to admit it.
Own up, do your penance with grace.

Mr Binary, you're a disgrace
To your otherwise numerous race.
Maybe useful in widgets,
You're deficient in digits.
(I just wrote these five lines to abase.)

Now King Arthur, he never got bored,
As with knights round the table he jawed,
But, make no mistake,
His best friend, from the lake,
Was Excalibur: one magic sword.

My sweet wife, Queen Louise of Estonia,
Is wearing a cubic zirconia.
Yes, her "diamond" is fake,
So my life is at stake
Should she learn it's a phoney-balonia.

Though her dancing en pointe was most deft,
Wistful dreams are now gone, she's bereft.
Not the prima, she'll stay
In the corps de ballet —
There she is, thirteenth swan from the left.

Once I heard a geometer snort:
"Avoid verbiage; make use of the short.
'Having two planes (not one)'
Is a phrase you should shun
When diplanar you have as resort."

Your fervent belief in the Rapture
Has, sadly for everyone, sapped your
Desire to care
About what's in the air:
All the carbon we now need to capture.

Here the river grows lazy and coils
In sauntering curves over soils
All sandy and baked,
Earthy thirst to be slaked;
Onwards, seawards, it languidly toils.

Now the cricket-bat willow's fame lies
In the cricket bats every team buys,
Since its wood is so fine—
So much stronger than pine
(Which would surely cause cricket's demise).

My mummy consulted a seer
And was told she'll be dead in a year.
Now she ceres herself tightly
In linen fortnightly,
Gets plastered, and cries in her bier.

The cornfloor is where they'd thrash corn
In the days long before I was born.
They would beat out the grain
'Til no chaff would remain
And their muscles felt tired and worn.

Said she: "Cedar Rapids, in Iowa?
Never been there." Said he: "Then I'll biowa
Round trip to that seat
Of Lin County.  My treat."
Said she: "What a generous giowa!"

Ms Minnelli, I loved Cabaret!
You were excellent!  So was Joel Grey.
Win the Oscar (your due)
And then I predict you
Will see blockbuster roles come your way.

So my shopping cart's staked out right here;
Since I'm doing my best, please don't jeer.
I'm a bag lady, poor,
Not too lucky, that's sure.
Gosh, I hope things go better next year.

When a peg simply begs for a tweaking,
Never switch from the pitch that you're seeking;
For G flat and F sharp,
When you're tuning your harp,
Are distinct, enharmonically speaking.

Creatorship goes to the One
Who made everything under the sun.
He formed with His hands
All the waters and lands,
And the garden where Satan had fun.

Once annoy implied more than "You spilt
Your lasagna all over my quilt."
It meant "hurt proper function."
See Venner's injunction:
Tobacco "annoyeth the milt."

As a babe, our boy Roy was quite big,
And he ate like a semi-starved pig—
Downing rattlesnake steaks
And tumbleweed cakes,
And sometimes a newton of fig.

On the wall of a Mafia tomb
Is inscribed Bada-bing-bada-boom.
It's a phrase (like percussion)
For ending discussion—
Symbolically meant, I assume.

Coefficients of accommodation
Give, for molecules, some explanation
Of the fraction that sticks
To a wall—four of six?
(The two others rebound in vibration).

We don't suffer identity rhymes,
Though I tend to submit them at times.
It's a blind spot I've got.
Tell me, why can't I spot
Such an obvious flaw in my rhymes?

Succession relies on a spare,
And a king needs to demonstrate flair
So the nation's in thrall
Of his status; then all
May be well for the crown prince, his heir.

Look, buddy, don't give me no lippidae —
Them bait bugs are sand crabs, or Hippidae.
And, no, they don't hop.
They're the dickens to cop —
They dig backward right lickitae-splickitae.

Says a man from Darjeeling named Matt,
"Our famed Ealing-bound tram's where it's at!
We declare with great pride
You'll enjoy a fine ride
(Just as long as you're wearing a hat)."

A trying young couple from Brill
Would altercate loudly until
They would call off the fight…
And then, feeling contrite,
They'd have makeup sex much louder still.

They tell me that consopiation
Brings parents release from frustration.
Lull-la-lee, lull-la-lay
They've been chanting all day,
To accomplish the infant's sedation.

Returning from space is no breeze:
You get fired to a zillion degrees.
The ablator will meet
And then shrug off the heat,
So the capsule reenters with ease.

From a number eleven alighting
("AT YOUR OWN RISK", it warned, in bold writing)
When it rounded a bend,
I bruised my rear end,
But I still found it rather exciting!

I fear he will conquer my heart.
If it's conquered, he'll tear it apart.
If I cave and give in—
Let the conqueror win—
I will not have been terribly smart.

Though our orchestra earns much repute
For its concerts that feature the lute,
There are fans who revere
The recorder and cheer
When my blockflöte toots, like a flute.

My spouse sips a Pepsi each day.
These drinks keep her headaches at bay.
It's hard to go clean
From this drug called caffeine.
Caffeinated, it seems, she will stay.

"Go away! You are being a pest!"
Said the gal to her unwanted guest.
Rather bugged, she yelled "Go!"
As she swatted just so,
Sending Betsy the Bug to her rest.

Said my daughter, "Uh, Dad?  I should mention
I'm a bad girl.  I scoff at convention.
Neither timid nor mild,
I am daring and wild,
Getting boys to pay ample attention."

When stapling some papers from scratch,
Why not pinch a bunch more for the batch?
Whether A4 or Letter,
There's nothing that's better
Than snatching a batch to attach.

In his attitudes never a stiffer gent,
My best friend, for wrong facts, couldn't give a cent.
No, "A weasel", he'd moan,
"Is quite weasel-y known,
Whilst a stoat, he is stoat-ally different!"

They discussed with their groomer, a Prussian,
How best they might dry their hound (Russian).
When Czar started quaking,
They saw what was making
Him drier: his shaking (decussion).

I thought that you'd give me a kiss—
Not a pale imitation like this.
It just doesn't seem fair
That you're kissing the air—
Where you aim for my cheek, and just miss.

Their project's abrupt termination
Leads our contract to sad degradation.
That which once was bestowed
We are no longer owed.
Is it breach? No, just deobligation.

My poor limerick on astrobiology
Was found wanting, without an apology,
Since among other tasks
This discipline asks:
How does space affect life's physiology?

"You are perjured, Sir Knight," he asserted.
"I shall baffle you: paint you inverted,
Heels up and head down,
And parade it through town,
Blowing trumpets, so all are alerted."

Uncle Lester, long-winded I guess,
Couldn't say what he wished to express—
What he wanted to say—
In a straightforward way.
He would stray from the point; he'd digress.

Listen up, I'll define acroama:
It is anything heard, like a drama
On a radio show,
Recitations of Poe—
Maybe even a speech by Obama.

Orestes should fear this epiphany:
Alecto, Magaera, Tisiphone!
Beware the Eumenides
When singing their threnodies;
You'll go mad when you hear their polyphony.

On vacation in mad, gay Paree,
I had seen all the sights there to see.
I grew listless and bored—
At the Louvre I snored.
To the French it was simply ennui.

The classical language called Latin
Was the itchiest "seat"  I have sat in.
My knowledge of grammar
Gave no aura of glamor
Hanging out in the bars of Manhattan.

From the largest of whales to the least
Eensy bumblebee bat, they've increased
In the sheltered and gentle
Warm womb: they're placental —
Eutherian, each a "true beast."

There is blood, flesh and bone that connects us
And some skin round about that protects us.
As the surgeon begins
On us Siamese twins,
We're cut up as his scalpel dissects us.

In a practice or office or school,
Assistants help out, as a rule,
While associates claim
Higher status by name
And consider rote chores quite uncool.

Visit Ireland—the "Emerald Isle";
You'll find greenery, mile after mile.
See its capital, Dublin;
You won't find it troublin'.
You'll smile and drink stout, Jackeen-style.

Wile E.C. and his kids (he has three) a
Short time ago played by the sea. A
Few shells in their pails
Were from true limpet snails
That belong to the genus Acmaea.

A dogtrot's a quick easy gait,
Like a mutt on a stroll with its mate.
And it's also a breezeway
'Tween cabins, an easeway
That's roofed to keep sun off your pate.

Twixt ocean and swale's warm embrace
Stand the sandhills, the dunes, sculptured grace.
Facing winds and the tide
(And some storms on the side)—
Tufts of beach grass hold dunes in their place.

"You look shot!" "I'm a mighty tired feller."
"Use my foldaway bed in the cellar."
"Gotta hide from the wife.
She's the soul of my life,
And a beaut, but at times she's a heller."

To savor an artichoke heart,
Trim the thorns from the top for a start.
Scrape the leaves, toss the choke
('Cause its name is no joke),
Then at last find that tenderest part.

A gas plate is part of a gun
In its breech where the hard work is done.
It's in a recess
Where it handles the stress
Of shooting for work or for fun.

A carriage or van on a train
Or a tram is a car, I maintain.
Call it box or buffet ...
Though a Streetcar, they say,
Named Desire can drive you insane.

The archaic equivalent weight
Can be used to determine the rate
At which acids combine,
Or electrolyzed brine
Will achieve elementary state.

Jump higher, run faster, hit harder!
To do so, she doped, so they barred 'er.
How's she feeling, caught cheating?
Who ruled "no competing"?
She's sadder. Decider: ASADA.

Six months pregnant: the young woman's fear
Is her spasms mean birthing-time's near.
But her wise next door neighbour
Declares, "It's false labour.
Your muscles are practising, dear."

It's an object we kicked (then we ran)
And a warship that battled Japan.
It's a prison, a loo,
And a derrière, too.
These are five of the meanings of can.

I rented Revenge of the Sith,
Whose intense allegorical pith
Is the battle between
Good and evil on screen.
It's a fable—part hit and part myth.

A visiting choir in Gibraltar
Sang Brahms' sacred psalms at the altar.
When the tenor said that
The soprano was flat,
She assaulted the prat with her psalter.

"Get your skates on!" she ordered. "You're late!"
She's not someone who stands for debate,
So I quickly complied,
Crashed my car, nearly died,
And was seven weeks late for our date.

Distributing rashes and wheezes
Is Angie, the girlfriend who pleases.
We dub "angiitis"
The symptoms that blight us,
A mixture of social diseases.

So much waiting for data to go
On its way to be processed — too slow!
Today's double buffering
Helps ease your suffering:
Hi-tech computer I/O.

Folks in Iowa tend to hate spice,
And garlic they think is "not nice."
For those in that land,
The bland leading the bland,
Salt and pepper are thought to suffice.

There's a problem that has me obsessed.
It keeps me awake; I can't rest.
Though I think day and night,
I just can't get it right:
Before barns, where did barn swallows nest?

You say that you spoke with Abe Lincoln;
You saw the Titanic was sinkin'.
Disorder delusional,
Mental, confusional —
Phantoms!  Or else you been drinkin'.

A Christian says, "Go, Jesus, go!"
While an atheist argues, "God, no."
But rather less caustic
Is someone agnostic,
Who just says, "Oh, I wouldn't know."

It's a cave. I'm a troglodyte — so?
Like your flat, it's my dwelling place though
If you think fixed abodes
Aren't your style, hit the roads.
Winnebagos make great 'homes to go'.

An achievement test claims it can show
What you've learned and may still need to know:
A proficiency test
With which you're assessed
For the standards you've fallen below.

It's a word that quite melted away,
Once was spoken, no longer in play.
A question of banishing?
No, more like a vanishing —
Deliquate deliquated, I'd say.

This channel runs chilly and bold,
But I've promises yet to uphold.
I'll be first in her bed
If I swim it, she said.
Keep it warm, doll; at "bed" I was sold.

My dad isn't ruled by the trends.
He contends that contentment depends
On controlling temptations,
Loving all God's creations,
And a circle of trustworthy friends.

You'd keep bees with a will and a zest,
Hence your new apicultural quest.
It's no difficult feat
And the honey's a treat,
But those mites—holy smokes, they're a pest!

"Dermatoglyphics!" Dan called, his voice heated.
In this quiz, he would not be defeated.
"Teacher, uncopyright-
able also I cite!"
(Fifteen letters where none are repeated.)

Ships use ensign flags, legally flown
To acknowledge which nation's their own.
My youngest son, Davy,
Has just joined the Navy
And also as Ensign is known.

Today's youngsters do not comprehend
That with pennies, we'd plenty to spend.
We would lick, suck or chew
For a brownie or two,
And have extra to share with a friend.

Thanks to leaving the tailgate ajar,
I've a sheep and a goat in my car,
Plus a thing used for spying
And something for tying.
Eye, kid, ewe, knot.  Look — there they are!

Whenever I see an enjamb-
ment, I scream because truly I am
Shocked. They're wretched! I cry
Out in pain since my eye-
balls are doubly assaulted. (Wham! Wham!)

The Beauty Heart radish is red
In the middle—it's nothing to dread,
For it's tasty inside.
With a white and green hide,
It's attractive when sliced—enough said.

After dinner, it's clear Dad provokes
Mother's wrath when he stands and says, "Folks,
While my wife does the dishes,
This gentleman's wish is:
Let's adjourn to the parlor for smokes."

It's the dead heart of Africa, Chad.
Civil war. Land-locked desert. All bad!
And it can't even claim
To have given its name
To a waste-paper product. How sad.

Whoever came up with the dream
That two biscuits would work as a team
With a soft creamy filler
That tastes of vanilla?
Let's all cheer for the dear custard cream!

Finger sandwiches (always so grand!)
Were the entree the cannibals planned.
They invite us and feed us;
To claim they mislead us
Would seem to be "biting the hand."

Caligula (Gibbon's my source)
Gave a high-profile post to his horse.
Horses aren't seen today
In top jobs with high pay.
Why?  They're all filled by asses, of course.

Amerigo caused quite a flap
When his math skills uncovered a gap.
He said with a laugh,
"Chris missed China by half!"
And so got his own name on the map.

For deterrence, we all have The Bomb,
So let's everyone chill and keep calm.
Starting nuclear war
Would make most mothers sore,
And you don't want to mess with my mom.

This combining form's commonly hung
On a root and means "feces" or "dung."
Coprozoic's a word
(In which copro- is heard)
For an ape who likes turds being flung.

Cobalt carbonate's pink. Mix with glaze.
Dip and fire your pot, then just gaze
And admire the true,
Glossy, rich cobalt blue—
Such alchemy's sure to amaze.

Bay myrtle's a flowering shrub
You can plant in a patio tub.
It is used to make candles
(From its wax). If one handles
The berries, one feels it—just rub.

The old hag exclaimed, "Soon I'll enjoy
An outstanding dish flavored with soy!"
Gretel cried after shovin'
Her into her oven,
"Not Hansel, the broth of a boy!"

Public worship, as led by a priest
In the Orthodox Church of the East,
And the Lutheran, too,
Is the way they pursue
Divine service: a true Holy feast.

"I hate NPR", groused the doryphore,
"From Garrison Keillor to StoryCorps."
Persistent, pedantic,
He'll drive anyone frantic.
There's no one on earth who can bore me more.

It's a fact that's established by Hubble:
We exist  on a vast cosmic bubble.
Are we specks on a froth
Of primordial broth —
Or mere lather for shaving God's stubble?

Foreign policy can be a killer, son.
Not a job for Steves Bannon or Miller, son.
Jared, be my first mate.
Helm our new ship of state.
I'll move Rex far away from the tiller, son.

My prized pet, who was doomed, I'll entomb.
Although heartsick with gloom, I'll embloom
With lilies (emblossom)
The grave of my possum.
He'll rest there in peace, I presume.

"How long has the Earth been encrusted?"
"We'll take a quick read through our trusted
Geological record —
Multi-layered, not checkered.
The answer can then be adjusted."

The photo collector, aghast,
Learned the hard way that dyes will not last.
Pigment prints preserve color
That's brilliant, not duller:
A Carbro print shines, unsurpassed.

A jock with an itch (he's athletic)
Needs salve with a mild anesthetic.
Says Vera, "Stay calm!
What I have in my palm
Is the bomb 'cause this balm's aloetic."

What's a didact? A person whose tactic
When speaking of, say, chiropractic,
Is unduly specific
And turns soporific.
He's preachy and dull—he's didactic.

Joe's toe had been sore and turned blue.
So his doctor advised him, "When you
See my specialist friend
Your foot's trouble will end:
He's a cobbler; a shoe nail's come through."

If you're feeling like filling your belly,
Anolini are pasta (tortelli).
The anole, a lizard,
May grace a bird's gizzard,
But rarely a kitchen or deli.

This film has producers who shine,
And the writing is top of the line.
It's the story of Munich's
Most pious of eunuchs.
So how does the castrate? Divine!

I am given to fits of hilarity,
Interspersed with rare moments of clarity.
When my mood isn't high,
I would rather just die—
This is caused by severe bipolarity.

His failure was wholly complete:
All his sled dogs were slaughtered for meat;
The North Pole remained distant,
And help nonexistent,
And frostbite got both of his feet.

When a whale has been beached, it is key
That we get the poor thing back to sea.
On the beach, it will die,
So the volunteers try
Daring rescues as shown on TV.

Ugh!  Figures!  Of course!  You're obsessed
With avoidance of germs.  Shoulda guessed
That I'd prove ineffectual
With anything sexual,
What with bodily fluids expressed.

I'm a frostbit old groundhog named Sam.
To the tropics I moved—Suriname.
Shadowed northward I rest,
Shadowed south from my nest:
An amphiscian Sam, now I am.

My earthquake gown? Now it's complete,
Long and loose from my neck to my feet.
Should the earth start to shake,
I'd stay warm through the quake,
While I spent the whole night in the street.

Does he dabble in stocks—try his luck?
Risk a thousand, or even one buck?
No, his rapid gyration
Can raise vegetation,
A collation from muck—dabbling duck.

Grandpa Jim had a criminal bent.
Grandpa Joe always owed two years' rent.
Grandmas Sally and Alice
Ran a cat house in Dallas—
From them my bilateral descent.

Each cadet is impeccably dressed
In a uniform, cleaned and then pressed.
They can all pass inspection
From any direction—
Right and left, front and rear; they're the best!

I established my son at the firm—
Gave him work, though the kid is a worm.
Being honest, I must
Make this judgment: he's just
A regrettably sad waste of sperm.

Close at hand, you were fiery insistence,
And none could ignore your existence,
But magnitude, scaled
To absolute, paled
To a glimmer at 10 parsecs' distance.

This session is extra complex. It
Is causing him stress, but he checks it.
So, aggressive egression
Or passive repression?
No, feck it! (He heads for the exit.)

Build new swimming baths? I say, hear hear!
Filled with asses' milk? That will, I fear,
Never get off the ground;
It won't happen. It's bound
To be dead in the water. Try beer!

Our compact is formal and solemn.
I'm bound, since I signed in one column.
It's a fait accompli;
Under seal, I agree—
You can ski before me on the slalom.

An examinate? Never, not me,
'Cause examined I don't want to be,
For the first ruddy question
Will cause indigestion
To quite an unheard-of degree.

Abjuratory statements recant.
For example, my great-great-great-aunt
First declared, "General Lee
Is the lover for me!"
(Later: "Take me, Ulysses S. Grant!")

In old movies you'll see them a lot,
But to buy one today? You cannot.
It's a crush hat and that
Is the kind that lies flat
Until *POP!* it's a top hat you've got.

"Get in!" — what you cry at success.
"Get out!" — "Go away! I feel stress!"
Get on: when you're aging.
Get off: hormones raging.
Get through: when you finish, I guess.

Deliberative bodies embrace
The need for debate to take place,
And freedom of speech
Is exerted by each
Of the members (till blue in the face).

Ancient Greeks ate their meals while reclining,
Spending hours in that way, gaily dining.
Did their elbows grow tired?
Was a pillow required?
And did spines later on need aligning?

He's assaulted our witness!  Let's pray
She will make it to trial; that way
His defense can weigh in.
We'll, outflanking his sin,
De bene esse, depose her today.

Armoniche (the pasta) is great
And looks wonderful served on a plate—
Each a tiny harmonica—
So serve some for Hanukkah.
Beats latkes (or so says my mate)!

Enceliopsis, a sun-loving plant,
Is called sunray by my Tucson aunt.
I sowed seeds in my yard,
But they died; the earth's hard.
In Alaska, some plants you just can't.

"Blood's constructed of cells, white and red.
Both are vital," the profiler said.
"So the total amount
Of each colour I'll count.
This may help to explain why you're dead."

When we cotise the bends, that refines
The escutcheon, enhancing its lines.
Narrow stripes on the pales
And the bars—such details
Are the stuff of heraldic designs.

A risqué homosexual, Darryl,
At Christmas decided to carol.
"Were it not seen as rude
I'd 'fa la' in the nude;
I'll instead don my gayest apparel."

As a sea that is bluer than blue,
The Aegean will beckon to you.
It has sunsets that charm,
While its islands disarm.
You will feel like an Argonaut, too.

I just learned this new fact. I'll expound:
Turns out ground water's never been ground
Like with coffee or beef.
It is really, in brief,
Normal water in aquifers found.

She's about picking flowers and heather
With complete disregard for the weather,
Wearing nary a shred.
Being out of her head,
She's gone out in the (brrrrr) altogether.

A goalie's sartorial splendor
(Regardless of belt or suspender)
Will oft avoid jeans
'Cause they're creaseless; that means
That there's no place to put the goaltender!

My full name is Adam N. Tine.
I am stubborn as hell — by design,
Adamantine.  "It's my way
Say I, "Or the highway!"
When begged, "Change your mind?" I decline!

Gadzooks! and Egad! still have force,
So they're oaths I commend and endorse.
I'm dismayed by the way
Folks use language today.
We're uncouth as a matter of coarse.

A good family man, thinking he could,
Sought a noun fit for rhyming with wood,
Asked for help from his brood:
"No! We're NOT in the mood."
(Food for thought) — Things got left where they stood.

After crossing the nave and the cross,
He stood staring at stalls—all that gloss!
Feeling awed and inspired,
Young Thomas inquired:
"Is this where monks sing to the Boss?"

A Hawaiian-Chinese man, Frank Luke
Knew sweet life as a teen was a fluke.
Now, in sweetness congealed,
Guava jam-like, he's sealed,
Giving aging his raging rebuke.

For auscultatory devices,
A stethoscope often suffices.
With Baby's heart thumping,
Expectant Mom's jumping,
And Father's concerned about prices.

Giant's Causeway: these columns or stacks
Were once thought to be giant-made tracks.
Were they built by an alien?
Perhaps an Australian?
Lava just flowed through some cracks.

This writing is called boustrophedon —
no deen dluow uoy thguoht uoy gnihtemos toN
This limerick site:
thgir/tfel neht, tfel/thgir tsuJ
That's how it is done, so now read on...

There is rhumba and samba and blues,
And there's polka and tap. You could choose
Dance music that's sweet
With a jazzy, quick beat,
Such as rock, rap, or pop. Move your shoes!

Two identical molecules set
Together?  A dimer you'll get.
"One and one don't make one,"
Eric wagers. He's done.
It's a dime Eric owes, for the bet.

I applied to enrol ad eundem
With credentials so bad that I stunned 'em.
What?  I'm not up to snuff?
My B.A.'s not enough?
I'll convince the top brass to defund 'em!

Chad's a drag—when he's with us, we lag.
The guy's boring, and often will nag,
But he's really a pest
When he's specially dressed
In his grandmother's best—he's in drag.

We're coarsened! It seems like two-thirds
Of our language is four-letter words.
An ungodly amount!
(I'm awaiting the count
From you lexicographical nerds.)

Him? A spook? I don't think he can sell it.
There's a rat around here—I can smell it!
He's no high-ranking guy
In the famed FBI.
Hell, that imbecile can't even spell it!

I discrepate liars, it's true,
Always singling out phonies like you
From those telling the truth.
Besides that, you're uncouth;
So depart — your adieu's overdue.

When the Academy hands out awards
To its Hollywood ladies and lords,
It's totally wacky:
"Who's stylish? Who's tacky?"
Is all each reporter records.

They don't speak, not a squeak; each took part
On TV, films we see, comic art.
Harpo, Pluto and Teller,
Snoopy, Clarabell, Keller,
Bean, Marceau: all are dumb, all are smart.

There's this old guy who claims he's a knight.
And his speech? An archaic delight.
Though it's all a huge act,
It's contagious, in fact.
Is he rich? Well, he doeth all right.

It will come as, I think, no surprise
To hear that my friend has square eyes.
His gogglebox stays
Switched on — every day's
Television — till he or it dies.

"You're a bubblehead!" That's what he called me;
I'll admit that the insult appalled me.
Though I totaled his car
As I drove through Joe's Bar,
Did he have to get angry? That galled me!

"I dare you," Athena once said,
"To win at the loom. Go ahead."
Arachne defied her—
And soon was a spider
Left hanging by one silken thread.

Szechuan chicken's a hit in Beijing.
Escargot gives a Frenchman his zing.
They're too fancy, I say.
In the U. S. of A.
Earthy meat and potatoes are king.

A limerick written in gibberish
Is flibbity flobbity flibberish,
Hickory-hockery,
Dickory-dockery,
Bibbidi-bobbidi bibberish!

"The cistern's filled up in this rain;
Time to move in a new one," said Jane.
"Something new that you've found?
Do you do this year 'round?"
"When the town says we're low, in the main."

Abby's weighted with flab; she's obese.
Week by week her girth seems to increase
As she puts on more fat.
Hope she diets — and that
Makes her dangerous weight-gaining cease.

A raccoon may look cute, but take care;
You may want to make friends, but beware;
Seems benign (in your yard),
But don't let down your guard:
A coon's nasty, has claws — it's a bear!

When I gaze up at night at the moon,
On a cool, lovely evening in June,
Though it sounds pedagogical,
My heart's aerological:
I pine for a weather balloon.

New Wave rock band, a bomber, a drink—
What's the common name forming the link?
If you said that you knew
It was B-52,
Then you're hip, and your memory's in sync.

Much simpler than, say, FTP,
What made Gopher appealing to me
(And of fabulous worth
Ere the internet's birth)
Was the hyperlinked knowledge, all free.

"Whitish skin, toothy scales; bless my soul!"
Said our guide, out on diving patrol,
"Fins ventral and dorsal—"
"Aren't you a choice morsel,"
The shark said, and swallowed him whole.

Some would tire of their Protestant clime
And break free for a new form sublime.
Later, others would cede
This derivative creed:
Devouts, fissile indeed, given time.

In old churches keen ringers take part
In the long practised change-ringing art.
There old bells are well swung
And long peals are well rung.
Why not come, take a rope, make a start?

A Couple of Guys means to say
That for lovin', there's more than one way.
Plus to make the strip merrier,
A Jack Russell terrier
Is featured and, yes, the dog's gay.

Just what causes your deep fascination
With me? Do I sense some flirtation?
Can it be my quick wit?
Or my beauty? That's it.
There's a smut on my nose? What frustration!

Genus Acris: The species names, Willis?
"They're blanchardi, um, crepitans, gryllus.
You find cricket frogs
In ditches and bogs."
(Like the frogs, he's puffed up and orgillous.)

If you wake each day yearning for booze
(Any drink alcoholic you'll choose)
And your body is raving
With alcohol craving,
These are all dipsomania clues.

There are two kinds of falconers, yes.
One's a longwinger, other one—guess—
Is a shortwinger, who
Is called austringer, too.
He trains goshawks to hunt with finesse.

Gordon Bowker's first name choice was odd
For a coffee shop meant to be mod.
His partner complained,
So he wisely refrained
And chose Starbucks instead. Thank you, God!

Once a year I'm inclined to spend days
In a telly-induced semi-haze,
When significant lucre
Funds championship snooker
And coloured balls trip round the baize.

Always here by my side, ever handy,
Is my architect's scale; it's a dandy:
With six scales on three faces,
It covers all bases.
And its pear wood bears scents of fine brandy.

"Roger's all mouth, no trousers," she said.
"Wish 'down there' was as big as his head.
When he gave me a peek,
Well, it just made me shriek—
That's with laughter, not lust for his bed."

We mean by the word animality
A beast's or a creature's vitality—
Those natural drives
Making animals' lives
Unrestrained by ingrained rationality.

A skeptic is spending infinity
Exploring the general vicinity
Of Heaven above
As a labor of love:
"It's divine to divine no divinity!"

The ballyhoo's ceased, and it's clear
What was hot, now is not, and—oh, dear—
Being star of the week
Was great fun at its peak,
But that's history; the downfall's now here.

Being fat means you have adiposity,
And it raises this odd curiosity:
These know-it-all nerds
Have me eating my words.
Were they food, I would be a monstrosity.

Very soon a long trip I must take,
But the brakes on my car make it shake.
I would buy them, but Joe,
I do not have the dough;
Kindly donate 'em. Give me a break!

My son's debonair and urbane,
And on horseback he plainly acts vain.
Should a dame catch his eye
As he's galloping by,
He just pulls to a stop—he draws rein.

Our geological survey has found
What's upon and far under the ground.
Let us therefore take stock:
Say, an aquifer? Rock?
Diamonds? Clamshells (an Indian mound)?

In some parts of the world the earth's crust
Has to give or its surface will bust.
Tectonic plates press
On each other. This stress
Crustal movement creates — dust to dust.

A bowlegged fellow sees beauty in
A large-breasted, thong-wearing cutie in
A Commonwealth isle,
So he flashes a smile.
He's a bandy and randy Bermudian.

Heathen peoples—you Gentiles—behold.
See my favour fall not on your fold.
You are genge, you're ging;
To your idols you cling—
Thus it says in the Bible of old.

That doctor put drops in my eyes,
Made my pupils both double in size.
See, atropine's made
From the deadly nightshade...
But I hope it won't cause my demise.

There's a medical field that's defined
As the biobehavioural kind.
There it's hoped and believed
That much good is achieved
By relating the body to mind.

Bratislava? You mean in Slovakia?
I know of no city that's wackier!
Under Communist rule
(Back when I was at school),
The whole place was decidedly tackier!

When in Paris, and feeling audacious,
I met Kate, who was cutely vivacious.
But in the hotel
My garlicky smell
Put her off: I was far too cepaceous.

I will sneak to your bed as you sleep,
And then tickle your toes. "Beep-beep-beep!"
You express what you feel
When you try to conceal
A surprised little squeal. It's an eep!

Your coin must be real—yessiree—
Nero ruled back in 60 AD.
But mine's a disgrace,
With Augustus's face
And a date that says 20 BC!

Through crowdfunding, you can raise cash
For pet projects.  The method's quite brash:
You make Internet pleas
For a lot of small fees
And then jumpstart your work with the stash.

She said, "Pass the fourchette." I'm a dork:
An ob-gyn, I knew not she meant "fork"!
"Pass a membranous fold
Of the labia?" Cold
Was her stare, and her dad blew his cork.

"Close your eyes! Open wide!" she'd entreat,
And I'd do it, awaiting a sweet.
She expected a smile,
But the flavor was vile
And my face was as red as that beet.

Charlie Mingus showed dignified grace
As he ran from home plate to first base.
He wrote "HIT!" in the dust—
On the baseline, I trust,
Since the letters were all uppercase.

If with Proteus or Pseudomonas
Your bladder's infected, the onus
Is on your physician
To treat your condition—
Then carbenicillin's a bonus.

I felt wild as a drunken bacchant;
I got dizzy and started to pant,
And entranced by his beard,
I felt weird, then I cheered—
When I dated Ulysses S. Grant.

A matador maid named Maria
Fights bulls in the nude; you should see her!
When she waves her muleta,
The view's even greater —
I've run off to join her cuadrilla.

Like proverbial bats out of hell,
There are people who hurry pell-mell
Between jobs, so more work
In each day is their perk.
I can't stop! I'm too busy as well.

The apostle of culture's sad soul
Now regrets the effects of his role.
The ironical cost
Paid for innocence lost
Leaves him beggared of faith, on the dole.

Diamond Donna's a doughty old dame,
Though her welcome's well-mannered and tame
When the men come to call.
This old bird's seen it all,
And will guard all her girls on the game.

Hello, clothes moth — come in, be my guest:
Eat your way through my fine Sunday Best.
Don't stop at one hole,
Make a hundred your goal;
I could do with a fancy string vest.

Coccinella's a beetle with spots
You may find in your best flower pots.
But this ladybug's nice,
Eating aphids and lice—
I love shiny red wings with black dots.

A support with three legs is a tripod;
With two legs, it must be a bipod.
But here's a new thought:
What provides my support
Has no legs at all — it's my iPod.

I will never, it seems, be retired;
I guess effortfulness was required.
I strived for enjoyment,
Tried part-time employment—
Hope Walmart soon tells me I'm hired.

"There are curtains that go from the ceiling
To the floor, and I find this appealing,"
Said the boss. "Once inside,
If you guys need to hide,
Your positions they'll keep from revealing."

With no rain in three months and a day,
We went down in the donga to pray.
It was like a bad dream
When a cloudburst upstream
Caused flash flooding that swept us away.

First the polar bear bridesmaids, complete
With the minister, beat a retreat.
Then the groom and the bride
And best man went to hide.
Every single last one had cold feet.

Pleathe don't hit me again like you juth did.
I can feel that my tooth hath been buthdid.
Now tho people won't mock,
I mutht go to the doc
And thit down for a plathtic bicuthpid.

I'm a crowdsourcing kind of a guy,
So I thought I would give this a try—
Open call for a line
Which I'll claim as all mine
(See below for the crowdsourced supply).

The abettor was someone who stood
Looking out for his friend from the 'hood.
For assisting a crime,
He's today doing time.
Some Samaritans aren't so Good.

You can find one in H and in A,
In the middle there, marking the way
From the left to the right
To prevent readers' fright.
Barless H's cause L-ish dismay.

A diode bridge: diodes galore.
That is, four — though three phases need more.
Regardless of which
Ways the in-currents switch,
Current output has DC in store.

This machine leaves me full of frustration.
When it's working, I'm feeling elation,
But its dead time is daunting;
It seems to be taunting—
It falters, then goes on vacation.

In the Wars of the Roses (two flowers),
This engagement's been raging for hours.
We'll continue the slaughter
Come hell or high water
(With occasional breaks to take showers).

I'm so sick of this clericate, John!
Tell the bishop we'd like to move on.
Yes, the office is high,
But the town here is dry —
Plus I'm bored here in Azerbaijan.

It's a mix-up, a cock-up: a mess
Which you carelessly failed to address.
It's a plan gone awry.
It's a kite that won't fly.
Do I think it's a balls-up? Oh, yes!

Antisepsis means everything's clean
With no virus or germ to be seen.
Antisepsis goes far
In the modern O.R.
Where it's used for preventing gangrene.

The majority party agree
With borders of zones to make free.
Re-shaping the sectors
Will split the electors,
So a swing in the vote they foresee.

I was sent on a goose chase.  You knew
I'd be wasting my time to pursue
Unobtainable aims.
I'm so sick of your games!
After 23 snipe hunts, I'm through!

If you're wimpy and skinny and frail,
With no muscles to speak of, and pale,
Then it's clear you should eat
Lots of steak and red meat—
And drink pints of our finest strong ale.

If you bang it real hard, you will moan—
This part of the elbow that's known
As a funny bone.  Why?
You won't laugh—you will cry!
It's so crazy, this sensitive bone.

This plant is not well: there's chlorosis.
It's yellow. But what diagnosis?
What caused this condition?
Light, water, nutrition?
Disease that could lead to necrosis?

It's an alloy of nickel and copper—
Hot or cold, a consistent volt stopper.
If an Istanbul raider
Robbed his local jewel trader,
He'd get constantan opal rings, proper!

As a serf you're protected, okay?
You work land for your noble; obey!
Fight his wars. Forget wages
In these middle ages,
For feudalism functions this way.

"My new coat," sighed Lenore, with remorse,
"Like the blanket you'd put on a horse,
Has been made of the stuff
That is scratchy and rough—
It's of dagswain, of grossness, of coarse!"

Ivan Pavlov made use of a bell
To condition his pets to its knell.
His dinnertime rule
Meant the canines would drool
For the food that the bell would foretell.

"The divorce will be fair to each side,
With a split of your assets." I tried,
But I couldn't stop thinkin'
Of watchin' a Lincoln
Mark IV Continental divide.

Said my broker, a slick  bloke named Chester,
"Now, Charlie I'm sorry to pester
You, but now is your time
To get off of the dime."
I'm the thousandth and final investor.

There once was a man with a beard
Who mused to himself, "I am feared
Of a limerick trap.
I would rather write rap.
I find anapests stupid," he sneered.

It seems agroecology's field
Is too broad to be fully revealed.
It requires innovations
In multiple nations—
And philosophies not quite congealed.

The catalog comes once a year;
Around Christmas it tends to appear.
It shows marvelous presents,
But not for us peasants;
The prices are always too dear.

You may hear the Fir Bolg were the root,
Or Iberian Celts. For it's moot
Where Black Irish  arose,
Or quite how. No one knows.
But brown eyes and black hair's the rare fruit.

An actress in France gave the name
To this dish and achieved lasting fame,
So we'll never forget.
As dessert, crêpe suzette
Sets both platter and passions aflame.

When daisies are dotting the lawn
That needs mowing, your kids have you torn:
"They're so pretty and white—
Dad, don't cut it tonight!"
(If you do, you'll be scorned in the morn.)

Constipation, I do understand,
Will cause patients to whine, and demand
Some instant relief:
Disimpaction, in brief.
Forgive me, I won't lend a hand.

Patriotic displays are so rare,
We're forgetful of freedoms we share.
True fidelity needs
Our allegiance to creeds
Of the nation, to which we should swear.

When I see Mary's name, I cry, "Bully!
Hooray! I'll be edited fully."
Need clarification?
Or repunctuation?
Each comment's succinct—never woolly.

I am corduroy, fabric of kings;
Of my virtues the fashion world sings;
Whereas you, Bedford cord,
Have been largely ignored,
Used for airmen's fatigues and such things.

"Oh my dear," said the husband affectedly
When his wife returned home unexpectedly.
"This young girl's so afraid
That we lay here and prayed —
And were doing it interconnectedly."

I furnish a vital supply line
To construction crews raising the skyline:
Croissants and concrete,
Since a worker must eat
(Though the baking is merely a byline).

States are battleground, purple, or swing
If not solidly right or left wing.
They could go either way.
Thus, the candidates pay
Several trips for the votes these states bring.

Though I thought that I'd been overlooked
When some shoplifted items I hooked,
I was caught in the shop
When observed by a cop
Who yelled, 'Gotcha!' (My goose had been cooked!)

No anti-drug lecture, now, bub.
You've inverted the words—that's the rub.
Marijuana plus flame?
No, the groundsel tree's name
Is consumption weed — some kinda shrub.

In the cold earth rots Willard E. Dunn,
Who'd robbed banks for both money and fun.
At his last heist got shot—
Said his shooter, "I thought
He had made a false move for his gun."

Wailed a poet, "God, send me a sign!
Or better yet — feed me a line."
And just as he said it,
Hot damn! He was fed it.
Ain't providence simply divine?

You may start with some sort of rotation,
Then move to a brand new location.
(That is Mx+v
To a math Ph.D.)
It is truly affine transformation.

The gastropod lives where it's wet,
And I wouldn't eat one on a bet.
I would first need a Valium.
Some haven't a pallium—
Achlamydate—those are worse yet!

When the cop saw a corpse in the bog, he
Found something that made him quite groggy:
Grayish fat, ear to ear.
It was adipocere:
That's what happens when dead heads get soggy.

This basketball star was a sayer
Of very tall tales as a layer
Of ladies in bed—
Twenty thousand, he said.
Wilt Chamberlain—man, what a player!

Anthropolite fossilised finds
Show in stone human forms of all kinds.
From these we infer
How their bodies once were,
Although not what occurred in their minds.

I've decided it's time to come clean.
I am almost a man, at fifteen,
So I say, Mom, with pride,
I've got nothing to hide.
Here's the truth: that is Dad's magazine.

Don't ignore my impassioned appeal.
I've a problem with which I can't deal.
Call this heartfelt request,
Springing straight from my breast,
Cri de coeur. That's how desperate I feel.

I, by Fred, was cajolingly told
That I had to, A, bet, or B, fold.
Fred explained most convincingly,
Coaxed me unmincingly  —
I was thus into choosing, cajoled.

Laker looks like the best of my hounds
And his voice has the bellingest sounds.
But he's senseless, is Lakey,
All goofy and flaky.
His gormlessness passes all bounds.

Are my boobies considered a breastwork?
No, it's nothing to do with my chestwork.
It's a hill one might find
That scared grunts hide behind,
Having done with their shovels their best work.

Britney Spears sent this email to me:
"Chris, you're all that a lover should be!"
(The above 15 words
Are, of course, for the birds,
Just the dream of a guy, 63.)

Coochie-coochie: a dance meant to please
Since the hips are not ever at ease.
They gyrate and grind
Till a man blows his mind—
More respectable (just) than striptease.

"What is better than one? I'd say no man!"
Old Maid Ruth says, "There's nothing below man."
Cryophobic is she,
So can someone tell me
Why she went out and married a snowman?

To cultivate (verb): farm or grow;
To encourage; to culture; to sow;
To foster; promote;
Nourish; rear; keep afloat.
Said of plants, or a friend, or a foe.

Degenerescence: this interesting word,
Meaning "rot or decay" that's occurred,
Is the longest, some claim,
Where each vowel's the same.
Any wordsmith would see that's absurd.

I'm the lord of the manor. It's grand
To have faldage: the right to command
Where my tenants' fine herds
Drop their little round turds.
Do your duty: manure my green land.

When my chestwig came off in her bed,
I complained to the makers, who said,
"Since epoxy could cripple
Your pecs (they'd not ripple),
Just velcro each nipple instead."

I'm a Renaissance man, through and through:
Tastes eclectic; a dilettante stew.
My interests diverse
Come replete with a curse —
I can't finish one thing that I do.

Shaping diamonds for years proved evasive.
Since each is a perfect abrasive,
The answer is bruting;
Beyond all disputing,
It works. The results are persuasive.

All those chemical changes were done
Without life taking part in the fun.
"Abiotic is best!"
All the non-life professed,
"When you're dead, we'll have only begun."

I engaged to assist my friend Joe
To sell knee-cap replacements "to go".
Yes, I promised I'd do
All the marketing too,
But a drive-thru? I had to say no.

My wife and I suffer from cenes-
thesiopathy, Doctor, a grayness
Of spirit. It's real,
This discomfort we feel,
Although no distinct organ will pain us.

Erasability doesn't exist
On the Internet. Those who insist
On expunging their stuff
Sadly learn soon enough
All their uploads will somehow persist.

Do you know of the reason, my dear,
Why this feast moves around every year?
This mnemonic's a boon:
Find the Paschal full moon,
The next Sunday is Easter Day. Clear?

When we outer from inner divide,
The term cortex (for "bark") is applied
To cerebral or renal
Or even adrenal—
While medulla means what is inside.

"Aromatherapeutics," said Pat,
"Will perk up our health just like that!"
But her husband resents
Spending dollars on scents:
"Darling, frankly, I just smell a rat."

Actor-buddy John Wayne was quite fond
Of his gruff-talking sidekick Ward Bond.
In a rare hunting fluke,
Ward was shot by the Duke.
Then his pants were the hue John had donned.

You need counterfeit stamps? I'll supply 'em—
Take my copying skills and apply 'em—
But I'm wasting the day
On your stamp's burelé;
Why not drive to the store and just buy 'em?

They undulate, surge, and they swell,
Those billowy waves, so pellmell.
Then you head for the rail
With a countenance pale,
And a vision of watery hell.

I don't know, so I'll have to confer
With my husband, the man I call "Sir".
I'll consult, we'll discuss,
Then with little more fuss
I'll be able, or not, to concur.

An angio- ("vessel related")
-cardiography clearly located
Your heart's clotted artery
That made you so martyry:
A balloon shall be soon there inflated…

Tallied ballots are piled in a heap,
But the total's been tricky to keep.
Since we're sure we've a miscount,
We'll offer a discount,
Recounting the ballots real cheap.

Were the Danites a Mormon excess
Who got blamed for a god-awful mess?
Did they start up a war
On a Clay County shore?
Church said, "No," but opponents said, "Yes."

On each cabriole leg of my chair,
There's a drake foot, or trifid, set square
On the floor. And no duck
Was the model: it's struck
From a dragon's, that is, from thin air.

At my workplace I hand-manufacture
Fine clocks, but Dupuytren's contracture
Now cripples my hands
With its damned fibrous bands.
It's disabling and worse than a fracture.

Astronomy? That's for some nerd.
The study of stars? How absurd!
The locus of dippers?
I'll focus on strippers
Who stroke us big tippers—I've heard.

A foreigner job-theft believer
Will not be a fan of Aviva.
Chomsky thinks immigration
Is good for the nation.
Is she right? Is Lou Dobbs a dumb diva?

It's from one of my favorite plays:
In the bosom of Arthur he lays.
Thus Sir John met his death.
So declares in one breath
Mistress Quickly—she butchers the phrase.

"No, this isn't a terrorist plot,"
She, embarrassed, explained. "I forgot
That alarms would go off.
Though I tried, I can't doff
My steel chastity belt—so can SWAT?"

Please don't tell me you're having "bad trips."
I want cash, not the lies from your lips.
Just hand over your bills
And I'll see you get pills.
I'm an author, but only write scrips.

Now Hannibal's one to opine
That broad beans go well with red wine.
With liver or lamb
(Or starling, or ham)
Chianti's especially fine.

Said Soviet chemist Derjaguin,
"Hey, Landau, come, lend me your noggin.
Charged colloid suspensions
Ought to last due to tensions —
The DLVO theory I'm floggin'."

You're a bully, and that I despise.
Don't beat up on those meek little guys!
That one's light, half your height;
If you're spoiling to fight,
Pick on someone who's more your own size!

A bedroom's a room with a bed.
It's defined in that line you've just read.
And it's also the place
I've been sent in disgrace,
Just for shaving my kid sister's head.

Why do we call autumn "the fall"
When all other seasons we call
By one name? Could it be
Autumn leaves on a tree
Which flutter to earth, one and all?

Once a corse was on fine fabric found;
Just a ribbon or band wrapped around
'Neath a girdle or garter
That made you look smarter—
It served as a plain coloured ground.

Not all limericks are lusty or lewd,
Or filthy, obscene, or just crude,
Or have purposes shady
Unfit for a lady,
But clean ones? All those I've eschewed.

To the whooping crane (avian elite),
And to egrets and geese, it's a sweet
Coastal site to delight
All wild hearts day and night
At Aransas,  their winter retreat.

She's wearing best satin and lace;
Applied scent in a secretive place;
Now she puts on foundation,
(She'll be a sensation!)
Mascara and lipstick — her face.

"Eoanthropus dawsoni! Folks,
Such great science this fossil evokes!"
Dawson stated, "I think
It's the ape-to-man link!"
Such a pity it all was a hoax.

Dress the part when you look for a job,
'Cause you'll want to stand out from the mob.
Let the clothing you wear
Boast a confident air.
Don't let on that you're really a slob.

When your screen was a big CRT,
A high voltage was needed to see
Any picture on screen.
This high voltage has been
What the flyback transformer set free.

In an alcove, there's curved marble seating
Used for many an intimate meeting—
Trysts sweet but forbidden.
The exedra's hidden
From those on the lookout for cheating.

An alternative energy force
Is required, as we steer a new course.
We've got winds, tides, the sun,
And can draw from each one
As we seek a new energy source.

Idle chatter is such a delight!
We discussed brands of gum, Vanna White,
What some teen idol said,
Comfy shoes, Mr. Ed.
Yes, we chaffered well into the night.

A bedchamber's what it would seem:
A place one can sleep, perchance dream,
Or taste the delights
That fill up the nights
Of couples from Kansas to Nîmes.

In the U.S. (that's my native land),
Achromycin's the name of the brand
Of the drug tetracycline,
That helped get my eye clean
When microbes infected a gland.

The word fable? A statement fictitious,
Maybe made for a purpose suspicious,
Like when guys choose to lie,
Hoping romance is nigh,
And say, "Sweetheart, this meatloaf's delicious!"

Said the chair of the Back-Handers' Board:
"I'm entitled to call myself 'Lord',
And my wife's now a Lady.
Activities shady
Have paid me this handsome reward."

Good Samaritan laws can protect you
From lawsuits you fear might deflect you
From helping a stranger
Who's facing a danger.
The courts will (correctly) respect you.

Japan now commands admiration.
Its autos reflect innovation.
Economically powered,
The country has flowered,
Becoming a bloomin' carnation.

When I visit the candidate's rally, I
Rouse folks who attend to back Sally. I
Make speeches that sway
The whole crowd. In that way,
I get votes from the seniors, et alii.

I was never addicted to pot;
As for smoking, I swear, I do not.
But sweet treats, I adore;
Once I start, I want more,
Though I know that my teeth may well rot.

A brachyceral gnu at the zoo
Possessed very short horns, and they grew
On his very short head,
So the zookeeper said
He was brachistocephalous, too.

No cute mittens or cute baby booticles
Stave off the damp for my fruiticles,
But thin coats that give maxi
Protection (they're waxy)
Will keep moisture in: epicuticles.

A heraldic device, apt for me,
In view of the pain in my knee
(Which is some sort of cramp),
Appears here, on my stamp:
It's known as a cross cramponee.

Adrift in a very small boat
And thankful that I could still float,
I yearned for more space
So I'd not have to face
Three hamsters, a cow, and a goat.

My life has turned drabbish and stale-ish;
What was satiny now feels percale-ish;
My singing sounds flat,
I'm ignored by my cat,
And my ale doesn't even taste alish.

If a gamer's to have a good day,
Certain strategies turn things his way.
Each choice of an action
Ensures satisfaction.
Thus determinacy comes into play.

My tortoise stud, Andy, is randy.
That's dandy for Sandy and Mandy
(The girls in my stable
Both willing and able).
He'll coot with them both if they're handy.

Folks who talked with James Bartley were awed,
Though his story appeared somewhat flawed.
This modern day Jonah?
His fides weren't bona.
His story was proven a fraud.

This poison you brought from the palace is
The type that can lead to paralysis,
But before there's anergia
You'll suffer dysergia—
A clumsiness. That's my analysis.

I like old-fashioned suitors: those who
Speak in out-of-date words when they woo.
I prefer they be calid,
Not tepid and pallid.
I find ancient words sexy; don't you?

You are culpable: you are to blame.
I am culpatory: "You are to blame."
There's me and there's you,
And our two points of view
Make these words mean exactly the same.

"The boats danced on the lake," said some clown.
"Did they waltz?" I replied with a frown.
So this guy raised his hand:
"No, you misunderstand.
I just mean that they bobbed up and down."

A reviewer sees things in advance,
Like a book or a play or a dance.
If he likes it, his praise
Can encourage a craze.
If he pans it, it hasn't a chance.

We need pads to ride bikes—they aren't joking!
Then the government says, "No more smoking."
Not really Big Brotherish,
It's more nagging motherish:
Wait an hour to swim after toking!

The old gate had just closed with a slam,
When the sentry looked out and said, "Damn!
Get your swords ready fast;
This poor gate will not last,
'Cause the Huns have a battering ram."

Peter Boyle played the dad Frank Barone.
His sarcastic asides were well known.
But he kept us entranced
As the monster who danced
While he put on the Ritz with a groan.

Bimillennium: this is a span
For which no human being can plan.
Think—would someone alive
In the year we call five
Have imagined a modern-day man?

That pole dancer din't cut the mustid
Since her skinniness left us disgusted.
Not stomachs but glances
Now turn when she dances:
Thanks to surgery, now she's re-busted.

So caught up in his cheeseparing ways,
Will's a miser—the guy never pays!
If you hand him the bill,
He turns violently ill.
Parsimonious Me! (His catchphrase.)

Did she swipe you with one of her paws?
Got a wound from those long, lethal claws?
Do you feel rough as hell?
Swollen lymph nodes as well?
Cat scratch fever is surely the cause.

Me an' Deb both think backpacking's swell:
Pack a lunch and go hike for a spell.
Plus there's open-air vice
And that spares us the price
Of a room at the local motel.

When you air seal your house it's essential:
A blower door checks residential
Air changes per hour
By noting fan power
At fifty pascals differential.

Fat Aunt Kay came to visit last May.
Said, "Strip poker, boys? Hey! Lemme play!"
Uncle Joe yelled, "Whoa, Whoa!
Playing that card game? No!"
And he took our large ante away.

To compaginate isn't to write
On or number your pages. You might
Use the word for a wall
Or a well-crafted ball.
It's "fit firmly together, unite."

I was clocked at one hundred and three.
Was this fair? Only to a degree;
Though the motorway cop
Flashed his lights and yelled "STOP!"
When you're drunk, how the hell can you see?

On the Nile, you are likely to see a
Graceful sailboat. I'm sure you'll agree a
Lovely picture 'twill make,
If a snapshot you take
Of the boat that folks call dahabeeyah.

"As I pulled on my clothes," said Louise,
"Chuck put snow in my shoe—what a tease!
Filled my left chukka boot;
When I screamed, he was cute;
Said, 'At least you won't freeze to your knees!' "

The truck's  driver might well have been warier
When inspecting his loaded car carrier.
He drove all the way
From Detroit to L.A.,
Never seeing the peeing fox terrier.

It's a term that sounds dated and quaint,
But a colourman makes or sells paint.
One who bumped off his spouse
Using gas in his house
Slapped a coat on to cover the taint.

Vocalis, it's "vocal" (he roared).
Dorsalis is "spinal" — you bored?
It's all these and all those,
So, like Gertrude Stein's rose,
We'll accord that a chorda's a "cord".

FDS on your vehicle? This
Denotes "this plate is German", not Swiss.
It's from Freudenstadt and
That's in Black Forest land,
Where cuckoo clocks don't go amiss.

On the genome there's just enough space
For each gene in its own proper place.
But alleles for each station
Can show variation,
Like alternate tails you might chase.

"A non-Catholic, please. We insist!"
Hanoverian, George made the list;
With the Whigs he held sway
In a Protestant way —
Leaving Jacobites thoroughly pissed.

A cardiovascular doc
Makes sure that your ticker can tock.
This surgeon who wrestles
With fast-food-filled vessels
Advises you, "Go for a wok."

We are all in this mess to the hilt.
Our society, once firmly built,
Has its framework decayed.
Our great fabric has frayed.
It is high time we patched up this quilt.

Epic chansons de geste laud heroic
Adventures of men, staunch and stoic,
Like dauntless Sir Roland
Who roams high- and lowland
For his king.  They seem paleozoic!

"Say it 'DAY-us,' or else say it 'DIE-us.'
Either way is okay; we've no bias,
And would people obey us
If we mandated 'DAY-us,'
Or," said guys on the dais, "defy us?"

Anonymousnesses: a noun
I've not spoken or heard around town.
Meaning "multiple states
Of unnamedness," it rates
A raised eyebrow—or maybe a frown.

When my firm laid me off, I responded
By forging some trades, then absconded.
I know my ex-bosses
Aren't hurt by the losses:
They're blanket fidelity bonded.

Mum and daughter were shopping in town,
When Mum spotted a beautiful gown:
"Though it's dear, we could share it
And take turns to wear it —
Go halves — split the cost. Why'd you frown?"

If you're pregnant, and feel a contraction
But no pain (just a squeezing-type action),
They're fake cramps — Braxton Hicks —
Simple uterine tricks!
A mere plug for the coming attraction.

These prices are foul. I must haggle!
"Dear sir," I said, finger a-waggle,
"Ten pounds for ten geese!
Who're you trying to fleece?
I'll pay five pounds—no more!—for a gaggle."

Bringing evidence forward at trial,
My attorney pulls pix from a file,
Which conclusively show
I was cruising the Po
When that bastard was stabbed on the Nile.

Does celery bring you delight?
Is it best when it's crispy and white?
Then beware of the fungus
That's lurking among us;
We call it the celery blight.

Here a cony (long ears, little tail)
Hops along on the lagomorph trail.
There a con, up a tree
With a cadged goober pea,
Waves its tail to impress a sweet frail.

A river, a valley, a strait,
All have openings where they dilate
At the end of their tours.
They are called debouchures,
From la bouche, French for mouth, to translate.

Monsieur Édouard's estates, posh, manorial,
And his sweatshops—they're extraterritorial,
So his smoke-belching foundries
Are outside our boundaries.
He acts like his rights are seigneurial.

If a blood clot blocks one of your veins,
You'll experience terrible pains.
As more blood cells congeal
(Red and white) you will feel
That you'll very soon wind up 'remains'.

Let vapor condense on a wall.
The drops are, initially, small.
When they grow, coalescence
Unites them in essence.
A liquid film forms and will fall.

Seven dwarves for Snow White: Start with Sneezy,
Then Dopey and Doc — this is breezy.
There's Happy and Sleepy
And Grumpy, who's creepy
(But no Bashful — he's shy and uneasy).

I'll bake us a fine langostino
And open a bottle of vino.
Then we'll turn on TV
And watch slalomers ski
In the Alpine events from Torino.

The old German city of Bingen
Was home to some fancy-ass singin',
As Hildegard's chants
Left the folks in a trance.
(It's a shame that her tunes ain't more swingin'.)

You forget how you hurt — act forgetfully.
You're not sorry — you act unregretfully.
You forget? No regret?
Well, that gets me upset!
I get irked — you can bet I'll act fretfully!

Your chuckles are put to the test;
Your guffaws are observed and assessed.
Cachinnation, we learn,
Is a function of turn.
Laughing last is the one who laughs best.

There's the rector, but why's he so glum?
'Butt' indeed! Know he spoke with a plum?
Well, to preach to the 'yoof',
He de-plummed to 'uncoof',
But they still think he speaks through his bum.

See this coffee- (or tea-) table book?
It'll grab you by hook or by crook.
It's too big for the shelf.
Did I write it myself?
I forget now — oh, yes — now I look…!

With an aval, a party agrees
To make good on the promise of fees
That is made by a buyer
Who's down to the wire
And can't make his payments with ease.

When bust-ups occur in the street,
With drunks rolling round at your feet
Swapping insults and punches,
A smart person's hunch is:
Be fleet and discreetly retreat.

The Edsels were named for a car.
Like the car, they din't go very far —
Just one hit, but a pearl
Of a song 'bout a girl
With a name that is pretty bizarre.

Districhiasis, found in my lashes,
Makes my eyes feel I've rubbed in some ashes.
I have doubled-up hairs:
Yes, I grow them in pairs.
Each a follicle shares—leads to clashes!

Her erratical takes? Disconcerting.
She often would laugh at my flirting,
But sometimes act sad,
And might even get mad;
Her moods were forever inverting.

Dick Clark built success after school:
Philly teens danced on Bandstand, looked cool
As groups lip-synced to hits,
Selling records. Clark's wits
Let him profit, no pay-for-play fool.

For the faithful, uncertainties vex,
Making science a pain in their necks.
Since there's certitude God
Can provide, it's not odd
Counterscience is strong in some sects.

When you see it's a duel you face,
Or a fresh chance to win in a race,
If the goal is compelling,
With logic that's telling,
The challenge you'll surely embrace.

"Those crooks! Gonna call the police!"
"On those boat-rental folks?" asked my niece.
"There's no captain or crew
Or supplies promised you,
But it may be you signed a dry lease."

To modify something, use fairly:
As that's rather better than barely.
If you said, "Fairly good",
You would be understood,
But "barely good"? — hardly, or rarely!

I busted my buttons, so proud
That my voice had excited the crowd:
They kept shouting loud cheers!
(Not for songs — it appears
I had boob-spill each time that I bowed.)

I expected to see something nice.
As described, it then seemed worth the price.
But it's shoddily made
And its worth's overplayed,
So, in short, it's a gimcrack device.

Because bloom-loving states of Australia
Might well, if you criticise, jailia,
I'm writing from where
Extradition's quite rare:
It's a failia, Australia's dahlia!

I was searching for Great Uncle Fred
In the census, and here's what I read:
He raised pigs, married Maud,
Also raised a large horde—
Twenty children! No wonder he's dead.

You're expecting you'll have the last word,
But your cats find that droll and absurd.
Though the logic you're selling
Seems clear and compelling,
Those are cats you're determined to herd.

If you aim at avoiding the trite,
And ensuring your prose can take flight,
You may well be graded
On how nouns are shaded —
That means getting your adjectives right.

A victim of serious burns
Finds it painful whenever he turns.
In his search for relief
From his torment and grief,
For an antipyrotic he yearns.

Andalusite, it isn't no jive
That for you I have taken a dive.
There's no ifs, ands, ore buts —
I've completely gone nuts
For your Al2SiO5!

Dialectical views you could coax
From those two argumentative blokes—
Not the term to betoken
Two dialects spoken
By bidialectalist folks.

Put in water to make a suspension?
Its makers might have that intention,
But it clumps into stuff
That a whisk's not enough
To deflocculate, please let me mention.

You can use me when surfing abroad
Or perhaps when your home is refloored.
I am found after sail,
Side, cup, plaster, and tail.
So what am I? That's right, I'm a board!

A definite integral's shown
As the area (specified zone)
'Tween the integrand's curve
And three lines, which may serve
As its outlines, with limits well-known.

Ordinarily, autos are cool,
Though a car bomber's seen as a ghoul.
Car bombs kill, a mean trick
That will cause dying quick.
His blind trust makes a bomber a  fool.

Mythic Fenrir, wild wolf of the Norse,
Is described in a very old source
That's both grim and esthetic:
Eddas (Prose and Poetic).
There he's known for his fierceness and force.

I would hope I'm not thought of as cold,
Though it's true that I could be more bold.
Mad desire's not for me
(Just a cup of weak tea)—
I'm asexual, or simply too old.

Our young cat's brought in mouse after mouse.
All alive, they're all over the house.
We have searched top to bottom,
But still haven't got 'em.
Small wonder I gripe and I grouse!

A chameleon turns green, brown, or blue.
A moth can have camouflage too.
To match what's surrounding
Is really astounding—
I wish I could do it. Don't you?

It's incredibly tough to be vocal —
Our alliance is national, not local;
But our chapter gets heard
(Though his words are absurd)
'Cause our chief's an ebullient yokel.

A garrison settlement's here
In a land Romans conquered with fear;
Of young soldiers bereft,
Only veterans left—
Now this colony meaning's quite clear.

The flash paper, subtly ignited,
Flared brightly.  The crowd grew excited.
The illusionist drew
A white hare into view.
Misdirected, the folks were delighted.

To counterweigh something, you push
Back against it with shoulders or tush.
Or you might employ rocks
Or a dumbbell or blocks
(Or a vote that repudiates Bush).

She was drawn to him right from the start,
And she longs for him when they're apart.
Now, throughout every day
That her love is away,
She is holding him close, in her heart.

I'll accept all your change without qualms
As I stand here extending my palms.
You don't want to sound dumb,
So don't call me a bum:
I'm an almsman.  You got any alms?

Is a cat rig aloft on a craft
Where the cats cry, "Fish ho!"? Don't be daft!
It's a mainsail tied fast
To a pleasure boat's mast,
From its forepaws right back to its aft.

Bacteriologists live in a daze,
A prokaryotical haze,
So in love with their task—
Growing germs in a flask—
That they don't think to ask for a raise.

Combustibility causes hostility
When ignition engulfs the nobility.
Yes, combustibleness
Is a burning distress
For a baron who's lacking agility.

Presenting a topic arcane
Is always a bit of a strain.
To convey what's obscure
Is a pain, to be sure.
I'd abstain, but my brain is too vain.

I humored my friend, who asked, "Why
Don't you give God and Jesus a try?"
So we went to a Mass.
"I don't mean to be crass,"
I soon whispered, "but check, please — goodbye."

"These high caratage rings mean I'm loved,"
Muses Minnie, who shortly is shoved
To get her attention
So Mickey might mention,
"Forget it: you're always out gloved."

A grobian said to me, "Dude
I'm ill bred, buffoonish and rude,
I am loutish, a boor,
But don't show me the door,
My presence should not be eschewed".

See the Wimbledon waitress who ferries
Dessert to the Barrie's and Terry's.
What's under the cream?
There's a shiny red gleam.
She's bacciferous: bearing them berries!

I just can't understand differentiation
Between good art and bad! Observation
Has made me conclude
Any nude—fine or crude—
Wins my deep, though unschooled, admiration.

She discovered you will not find locks
In a deli—that's not what it stocks—
But it's there you'll examine
Some tasty smoked salmon.
On bagels, with cream cheese, it rocks!

"Disabling your wireless adaptor" —
The perennial opening chapter
In the modern-day daring
Of network-repairing.
"It's broken", I think, would be apter.

Deaf-mutism never would suit
A parvenu name-dropping snoot.
Without hearing or speaking,
The advantage he's seeking
Would seldom, if ever, compute.

Round the hourglass figure of Gwen
Gather nine extrospective young men.
Self-absorption is not
To be found in this lot
As they outwardly shout, "Perfect 10!"

This embroidery styling is couching,
And you'll learn it today without grouching.
Your designs will be made
After threads have been laid
And then fastened by stitches—no slouching!

What is the sole purpose of the occupant of room 9?
