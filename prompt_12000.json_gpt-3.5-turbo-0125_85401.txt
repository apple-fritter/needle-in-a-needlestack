This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.



Whilst Adam was praying in chapel,
Young Eve popped around with an apple.
"Dear," she said, "take a bite!"
Which he did, with delight;
Now with knowledge of evil they grapple.

Our membership's starting to droop,
And our losses we need to recoup.
To revitalize things
With the spirit that brings,
Let's recruit some fresh blood to our group.

It sells playthings of marvelous sorts
And equipment for little kids' sports.
It's a landmark; what's more,
It's my favorite store—
The cool toyshop called FAO Schwarz.

Our most serious faces we don
As the blamestorming session goes on.
Someone died. Who's to blame?
The one person we name
Is a janitor's helper named Juan.

If you're craving a snack with some zing,
Grab a zesty, fried Buffalo wing.
Lay the bleu cheese on thick;
Add a celery stick.
It's a munchie that's fit for a king.

If you use a medicinal tampon,
Just which is the part it will clamp on?
Later, if you feel pain
That makes you complain,
Is it men that you blame the worst cramp on?

A caudex, as botanists learn,
Is the stem of a palm or a fern,
Or the tangled wood base
Of a plant I embrace—
The perennial, oft to return.

The Emperor, as everyone knows,
Ends orations with terminal prose.
Where he once waxed devout,
He now hollers, "Peace out!"
We call it the Emperor's new close.

Dump the masks. This new "flu", it'll pass.
Drink some bleach on the beach. Quaff a glass.
Ignore  Fauci and Birx—
That drug chlorophine works.
One more thing—shine UV up your ass.

I'm a green-hearted arbitrage planner,
Taking cans from Fort Wayne, Indiana,
To Detroit, where they each
Yield a dime — what a peach! —
Which explains my insouciant manner.

When you're causing a liquid to flow
Through a porous material, so
Induced by applying
A current, you're trying
Electro-osmosis you know.

As you wait, please take note of the comma:
Though too short for the pearl-diving ama,
In a series, in clauses,
Wherever it pauses,
It modifies, keeping down drama.

The adverb's a versatile guy:
It modifies verbs, low and high,
And all adjectives too;
Then it adds to the brew
Words like also, how, when, where, and why.

What's a fundus (from Latin for bottom)?
Well, some hollow organs have got 'em —
Have fundi, that is.
See, the bladder (gee whiz)
Has just one, while the brain has a lot. Um,

The brain's many fundi are wee,
One in each tiny groove that you see
At dissection. The other,
Be you kid, dad or mother,
Is across from the hole for your pee.

She hails from across the Pacific,
And her methods are quite scientific.
As a baker? Terrific!
Her output's prolific;
Her breads are all crisp and crustific.

In the lab, they looked far and looked wide
For this peptide! Oh my, how they tried!
They were all in a bind;
Their research could not find
AASH.  It wounded their pride.

The word bed is a term that appeals
To those folks who like bivalve-y meals.
It means groups of, you know,
Clams and oysters, although
It can also denote snakes or eels.

He's a blogger, an Internet bore
With unwanted opinions galore.
Once you've read what he thinks,
You'll find dozens more links
In his blogroll. Feel free to explore!

In Beslan, the terrorist shows
The depths to which wickedness goes,
Having goons in his squad
Killing children—for God?
Damn this scum to perpetual throes!

I am easing down into the pool
Just a step at a time (it's too cool).
They're complaining that I'm
Taking way too much time,
As if leaping in's some kind of rule.

He was typical TV news fare:
Perfect teeth, perfect clothes, perfect hair.
But the things that he said?
He's a damn barking head!
He's aggressive, abusive, unfair.

The bunchberry creeps near a wall;
It's an herb, only three inches tall.
This perennial plant
Is a dogwood that can't
Stand erect, so it chooses to crawl.

Says an actress of fading mystique:
"I despise this new camera technique!
Deep focus draws eyes
To the background," she sighs,
"And away from my famous physique."

U.S. women aren't flat-chested. See,
They're full-bodied, not A and not B.
From Denver to Dover,
Their cups runneth over—
Average bra: 34 Double-D.

Poems are joys; you recite and repeat 'em,
But, while lovely, one thing sure can beat 'em:
Trees, as Kilmer conceived,
And good dryads believed.
Check that out at the right arboretum.

Alabama's a tolerant state:
Most inhabitants harbor no hate
For outsiders and blacks,
As today they relax
In communities, locking the gate.

Fetoproteins, unseen since the womb,
When they surge late in life, may spell doom.
If they're alpha, the answer
May be liver cancer —
More tests may yet save you from gloom.

Oh, don't throw your toys out your pram!
Yes, I treat all your emails as spam.
Hurt your feelings? Don't care;
I don't like you, so there!
Just accept that I don't give a damn!

That decitizenized rat's a state traitor.
Those people who loved her now hate 'er.
Of her country bereft,
Her homeland she's left —
Glad it happened right now, and not later.

To the day that they knock on death's door,
All the rich receive blessings galore:
Massive homes, fancy cars,
Ten-inch Cuban cigars,
But the poor just get kids, nothing more.

Said a wealthy young man from Bohemia,
"You'll stay poor if you choose academia.
My success—I've no debts—
With invertebrate pets
Is with sea monkeys, genus Artemia."

At the peak of Mount Burton it's breezy.
Some say gaining that point makes one queasy.
Climbers claim for this test
That the north face is best,
But I just took the ski lift. It's easy!

"This mixed-up, disorderly bar,"
I declare, "is my favorite by far!"
Adds a Bronxite, disjointly,
Not quite to-the-point-ly:
"Dis joint's an exploding cigar!"

The signs of entombment abound
For the critters that dig under ground:
Thus gophers will often
Run into a coffin
With signs that read, "Please go around!"

Before you have ice cream and pie,
These burgers and fries you must try.
Then some pasta and bread
With some buttery spread.
This meal is calorically high!

Who's caused famine and wide deprivation
Since our forefathers founded our nation?
Their descendants (we knaves).
They would turn in their graves
At the errors of this generation.

Determined, persistent, and driven,
That hole that he digs he can live in.
(It's really that big.)
But I don't give a fig —
Though he's dogged, my dog, he's forgiven.

I complained to the judge quite emphatically:
"No big screen? No fans screaming ecstatically?
Paparazzi? Like hell!
No red carpet as well.
This is not what I'd call 'cinematically'!"

Are these throw-away kids we can spare?
Is their treatment humane? Is it fair?
For the children not blessed
With good homes, do your best
To provide them with good foster care.

I'm a monk (that is, "one who rejects
All his earthly, unseemly effects").
If I'd known of the price,
Though, I may have thought twice:
Till the day that I die, no more sex?!

The cedar has red-colored wood;
It's fragrant and smells rather good.
Deterring the moths
From my very fine cloths,
My cedar chest does what it should.

The poet, he plays roles for real.
His emotions he needs not to steal.
Although he's an actor,
It still is a factor,
His pain he pretends not to feel.

Consider  Sir Jagadis Bose,
Who crowed in a moment jocose,
"Solari?  Marconi?
A fake and a phony!
Those guys didn't even come close!"

On the eve of Zev's wedding, the guys
Throw his bachelor party: Surprise!
They drink beer, leer at strippers
(Who unzip all Zev's zippers),
As his bachelorhood speeds toward demise.

Martian features?  I'm hard to convince
That Cydonia is sculpted,  but since
It includes the odd shape,
Not quite human or ape,
Are you sure that it isn't a quince?

At first the poor victim can't sleep.
The descent to dementia is steep.
The genetics are dire:
Half his kids will expire
Of the illness, so families weep.

Sabers drawn, flashing steel, row on row,
In the wars not all that long ago:
They'd engage, they'd connect,
With horrendous effect.
Edged weapons would slice through a foe.

As I flipped a few steaks on the grill,
One thick sirloin dropped in. (That takes skill!)
So I yelled, "Sister, dear,
Free this meat from down there."
"I am not your commis, Bossy Bill!"

That's a first-day-of-issue cachet
And it's postmarked, of course, the same day,
Conceived and designed
With this issue in mind.
Is it rare? Don't get carried away.

On a pole, it's a fuse and a switch
That will pop if there's ever a hitch.
This fuse cut-out falls free
So the lineman can see
Where the fuse is that's causing the glitch.

It's a less-than-desirable trait
To let biliousness show on a date.
Keep your spleen, then, unvented
Till the bond is cemented,
And wait until marriage to grate.

"Dig up dirt on the guber affairs
Of Ms. Palin; our readership cares,"
Says The Times, "but don't try
To go after our guy,
Like with Reverend Wright and Bill Ayers."

I bought Auntie Maggie a fax
In one of those "get money back"s;
But the rebate upset her.
To make her feel better,
I said, "Auntie, kick back and relax!"

Learn aerodynamics and know
How the air round your glider will flow.
Your reasoning's obtuse
With that friction excuse;
It's the pressure that drags when you go.

Your website I'm trying to hack
By employing a dictionary attack.
What's your password? Don't know,
So instead I will go
Through an A to Z list front to back.

"Grab your shovel!" my wife says to goad
Me outside in the snow. There's a load
In the driveway. The car
Isn't going too far
Till I clear out a path to the road.

There's a nest holding eggs in the hutch,
Where a hen is abrood—nothing much
Has been happening here,
But if cracks should appear,
Then some chick's coming through in the clutch.

While the horsy set may have the hots
For the nags, at some pleasure craft spots—
In the boaty society—
An odd sort of piety
Reveres the best clinker-built yachts.

With his financing out of control,
Having mortgaged both body and soul,
Ed turned to the Mob
To bankroll the job.
Their investment's his ace in the hole.

The vagina may harbor a threat.
Cytological study will let
Women know — cell collection
Aids cancer detection
With help from a cytopipette.

In my fury, I carelessly choose
Purveyors of death to abuse.
These monsters I slang
Now behead, blast, and hang
Guys like me on the ten o'clock news.

Insignificant? Think of your skin,
And the casings throughout your within.
So don't make it an issue:
Epithelial tissue
Is crucial for holding stuff in.

A blue-blooded Brahmin I found
Looks so regal, her face pale and round.
In a pic on her table
She's dressed in lush sable
And coroneted — royally crowned.

Divorces can prime anger's flow,
And rudeness begets quid pro quo.
Then a judge will impose,
Upon crudeness, a close.
Why in civil court, I'll never know.

Aberfan, Friday morn, people cried
When the waste tip just started to slide;
With a rumble it came
Down the hill. Now the name
Will be known for the children that died.

I know that the rumors are baseless,
And the people who spread them are faceless,
But I heard on the wire
Where there's smoke, there's a fire.
So darling, I'm forced to be graceless.

When I execute stunts on trapeze,
All the crowd becomes weak at the knees.
Certain death is a threat
Since there isn't a net,
Which is why I collect hefty fees.

In Jurassic days, huge allosaurs
Had no hygiene; they lived out-of-doors.
But if they'd worn diapers
And used windshield wipers,
Their eyes would be clean. Not their drawers.

Collaborators each take a part
(Like songwriters Rogers & Hart,
Or Lerner & Loewe)
In creating a show:
They both must be clever and smart.

You're not such a bad sort of bloke,
But your cricketing skills are a joke.
You first lift up the bat
But then leave it at that.
Such a backlift should augur a stroke!

A blooper occurs, I daresay,
When deportment turns quickly outré.
An example I'll offer
To zealot or scoffer:
Shampooing inside a bidet.

The way my head shines is enraging!
My hair was once long and engaging.
My love life's the pits
And my doctor says it's
All a part of the process of aging.

Said our teacher, "Please do as you're bidden;
Report on the meaning of midden."
"It's a dumpsite where—crash!—
People toss all their trash
In broad daylight; they don't keep it hidden."

A capital letter's not a,
And not m, i, l, f,  o or k.
It's an upper-case Q,
A, B, X, P or U,
Or M, I, L, F, O or K.

The gorgeous tiara was coral,
But a gift she considered immoral:
"It's against my beliefs
To destroy Nature's reefs!
We should settle for wreaths made of laurel."

She's tiny, and birdlike, and old,
With a heart that is spun of pure gold.
As homeward I skitter,
Gram will chirpily twitter,
"Zip your jacket! The weather is cold!"

Deviationism marks you a splitter;
Party stalwart turned into a quitter.
The collective has voted
To have you demoted
From the penthouse straight out to the shitter.

Though cunjevoi may look salacious,
It means "sea squirt", or "plant that's araceous".
Words that start C-U-N
Are suggestive to men,
But in this case that notion's fallacious.

Dr. Anderson, first of her sex
In Great Britain in many respects,
Is remembered today
In a medical way
That, I'm sorry, this author rejects.

Do you see all this water that's rushing
Away? I can't stop it from gushing.
This sure ain't no joke;
My W.C.'s broke—
And I just cannot stop it from flushing!

I'm part of an atheist squad
Of performers.  The concept is odd,
As revealed in the skit
Where we ponder a bit,
Entertaining the notion of God.

Point your mobile to online dotcoms
To do business and shop from your palms.
It's become quite routine
To be glued to the screen
During dinner — without any qualms!

"Crazy cookie" they call me. It's wrong.
"Flaky fruitcake" as well. I am strong.
I'm a cake and accept
I've been raised quite inept,
For my mum was a wafer too long.

A calcifuge planted in lime
Will be in for a difficult time.
Camellias toil
In an alkaline soil,
As they do in a blistering clime.

Define cumulose thus: "full of heaps"  —
Like a cloud in the sky as it creeps
Along its slow course,
Or what's left by a horse,
Which the stableboy grudgingly sweeps.

If a booklet's a book that's no biggie,
And a piglet's a tiny wee piggy,
Then a branchlet's a stick
That is not very thick
(But it isn't as thin as a twiggy!).

The case neoliberals have made
About why to engage in free trade
Has held sway for some years;
Old protectionist fears
Are outmoded, although not allayed.

If your home is designed just for show,
But the standard achieved is real low,
And the knick-knacks you keep
Are both pointless and cheap,
That's gimcrackery—useless, you know!

First he stumbled, fell back at the gun,
Got boxed in (he had no room to run),
Found a gap and ran wide,
Had to lengthen his stride:
So our boy came from nowhere and won.

Said two virgins called Linda and Lydia,
Infected by many clostridia,
"The germ that's upsettin' us—
We hope it ain't tetanus.
At least we don't think it's chlamydia."

The adrenals are glands that produce
Nature's cortisol (athletes say "juice").
It can help to abate
Inflammation—that's great,
But injecting too much is abuse.

Certain hosts one should not underrate.
Ever see William Buckley debate?
He'd be warm and polite—
And eternally right—
Only victims stepped up to that plate.

I was shopping, comparing the prices
Of five data input devices:
Two keyboards, a scanner
(Not sure in which manner
To say this) and two cordless mices?

The birthstone of violet quartz
Known as amethyst, legend purports,
Protects one from drinking,
So imbibe without thinking
From cups made from gems of these sorts.

Evangelistary: open to find
Gospel readings—but some have opined
It means pulpit as well.
Are they right? Who can tell?
Even Oxford can't make up its mind.

My graduateship started last year,
When I passed my exams nice and clear.
Now a graduate I am,
And I hope Uncle Sam
Has a job for me. (Look, Sir, I'm here!)

Though I know they are far, far away,
I can see them nearby hard at play.
Their joyful embrace,
Their tears on my face,
Sweep them home, in a flash: Father's Day.

When a substance with vinegar's mated,
An acidified mixture's created.
When this case has occurred,
There's a chemical word
That describes it: it's then acetated.

She sang country and crossover pop.
Raw emotion led straight to the top.
Patsy Cline would assert,
"I just sing like I hurt
Inside."  Truly, the cream of the crop.

When the ghost (apparition) had neared,
She was nearly as weird as we feared.
We could scarcely detect her,
And didn't expect her:
A spectre who jeeringly sneered.

He adventured by roving around.
For this errantry he was renowned,
As he was for the logs
Of his journeys through bogs,
Which described errant trees he had found.

Blades of cut-grass are tapered and thin;
Their hooked edges can catch and slice skin.
When I sat on it bare-assed
I fled from it — tear-assed!
Since some float in mats, don't fall in.

With my ski-mask, my cleats and thick gloves
I creeps on the ice. I just loves
When I robs an old bat:
A mere touch and she's flat.
I'm a crymophile, push comes to shoves.

This old shrine's fallen into decline,
Infested with vermin and swine;
Once holy, now lowly.
Exaugurate wholly
This site (so, ordained "not divine").

The carrying capacity tells
Us the number of hares or gazelles
(Be they few or a lot)
That can live in a spot
And inhabit its meadows and dells.

Ancient iron, in odd aggregations,
Occurs in red banded formations
Spurred by algae (blue-green)'s
Metabolic routines
And their oxygen gas emanations.

Our Arabian camel (one hump),
Seeing poor punctuation, will grump.
Our proofreading dromedary,
If we've not commaed re-
sponsibly, spits like a pump.

A breakout of numbers provides
Analytical views from all sides.
Since these data divisions
Inform our decisions,
We hope they're reliable guides.

Chinese drip drip drip drip drip drip drip
Drip drip water drip drip drip drip drip
Drip drip torture drip drip
Drip drip drip drip drip drip
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip.

Tineolas, we're not like the fruit fly
(We concede, orange-eyed, they're a cute fly):
We can't stand foam or froth;
Favorite fodder —  'whole cloth',
We eat dry. Just ask any astute fly.

This great bagel is Maisie's creation.
It's a circle, precise in formation,
With a round space inside.
Maisie's smiling with pride;
She's in charge of the dough's entortilation.

I know could not's contraction is couldn't;
Some others are I'm, can't and shouldn't.
Changing it is to it's?
Join it up, and lose bits.
(Do you think that this limerick is goodn't?)

Dickie's dabbed it up (shacked up) with Liz,
So they're sleeping together. He is,
I well know, a swell feller.
'Bout us, should I tell 'er
(Although it is none of her biz)?

We elected a principled fellow
To Congress, who quickly turned yellow.
With his courage askew,
I'm ashamed by this true
Gutless wonder whose spine is like jello.

"Welcum, genmin," he said, with a drawl,
"Y'all needs no interduckshun at awl."
Then, as though to confide,
The man gestured inside.
"An' there's wimmin enuff; have a bawl."

I'd had every chance to succeed,
With all possible breaks guaranteed.
Now full grown, I have failed.
I'm despondent and jailed.
I attribute my downfall to weed.

I'm a mite that you might call polite.
May I ride on your hide out of sight?
Ectozoic, that's me,
Parasitic and wee.
Please excuse me, I must have a bite.

As a teen, I was always complaining
That my life was so unentertaining.
I craved parties instead.
"Join the service," they said.
"Right away you will get bacchic training."

"The old rudder's outdated, dear feller,"
Said the nautical power-plant seller.
"This swivels right 'round,
And its force will astound.
Try this azimuth thruster; it's stellar."

This shrub to the West is a stranger,
But it transplants without any danger.
It's better at climbing
Than its name is at rhyming—
We call it the climbing hydrangea.

Alleghenies: the place I call home,
Where the forests are rich with dark loam;
And the views here are pretty,
Not like in the city.
From this place I never shall roam.

Alfred Wegener measures each rift
And deduces that continents shift.
Then he hatches a theory
On plates with a query:
"Tectonics? You catching my drift?"

As birds empty seeds from a pot
Or Joe's finger removes nasal snot;
Like a fire-bell's call:
Evacuators all.
Can you empty your mind and think squat?

Pelosi still rules as the speaker,
But I wish that her powers were weaker.
What she heard, she denied,
But I think that she lied.
I disdainfully call her the "squeaker."

We were "married," but someone objects.
They've explained it; it's very complex.
An impediment ruled
To be diriment fooled
Us; I guess that was null-nuptial sex.

A groper is not what you'd wish
As a person — but fine as a fish.
It's found in warm seas
And its flavour will please;
Pan-fried it's a wonderful dish.

In the monsoons, it sure would be folly
Stepping out-of-doors minus your brolly.
Getting drenched in the rain,
Soaking wet — that's a pain,
Though the child in you might find it jolly.

Amadeus made famous a giggle
So infectious it caused me to wriggle.
When laughed by Tom Hulce,
It made me convulse,
Then roll on my back and just wiggle.

The Big Apple and Beantown are places
The average native embraces.
They are home, in large part,
To both commerce and art
And, come winter, to frostbitten faces.

Being mere flesh and blood, and not steel,
He was broken, I read, on the wheel.
All the witnesses claimed
He'd been brutally maimed,
Though that was, I suppose, the appeal.

So the bulk of the text was like this,
The main content no reader could miss.
But the author then wrote
An explanatory note
At the end*.

* Like a love-letter's X.

If great palindromes happen to thrill ya,
Then I'd say that you have ailihphilia.
It's not in the lexicon?
Not even the Mexican?
You won't rule it out I hope, will ya?

To compose a morose epicedium
Can brighten one's torpor and tedium.
I myself have an urge
To create a sad dirge —
One not overly mournful, just medium.

"We tried to traverse Logan's Lake —
Get across it —  by raft.  Bad mistake.
So we stole your canoe
And the paddles thereto;
Heartfelt thanks go to you!"
                  Jan 'n' Blake

My grandma was always afraid
That her fine reputation would fade
If she ever were caught in
Presenting store-boughten
Lasagna, instead of home-made.

With the sound of a freight train, or thunder,
The tornado descends, and we wonder
From here, underground,
Is our home safe and sound?
Or completely destroyed, torn asunder?

I attend a collegiate church
With six pastors, and now there's a search
For a new senior pastor
Who quickly must master
A college church study-fueled perch.

A Bernoulli trial only can go
In two ways—it's a "yes" or a "no."
Its results, not elusive,
Are mutually exclusive.
Is that clear? Let's get on with the show!

Jews and Gentiles united! A vision
We no longer greet with derision—
We send Barsabas back,
Who will cut you some slack:
Abjure idols; forego circumcision.

Close a loop.  It's designed to impart
Circulation for pumps or a heart:
Fluid up, fluid down,
Fluid out and aroun',
Reappearing anon at the start.

On TV, these experienced actors
Play surgeons. Some relevant factors
Are their talents with tools,
So they don't look like fools
Pulling tonsils or teeth with extractors.

A bright COBOL writer named Dunn,
Who had worked on the UNIVAC I,
Said he thought it was fine
To have top-down design,
But, mostly, the program should run!

My new robot's a golfing machine.
It can drive balls the farthest I've seen.
But there's one minor kink
That I have to rethink:
It putts four hundred yards on each green.

"It's just ignorant use. I reject
All this verbing of dull disrespect."
"Oh, Dad, don't be snide.
As a verb," I replied,
"It dates back to King James. I just checked."

The Chinese Revolution, game changer,
Brought in Mao and the Communist danger.
When Russia aligned
With China, that kind
Of a deal then made danger no stranger.

The bout she envisioned was whirling
About, with her petticoats swirling,
And dancing till morn—
So her husband was torn,
Since the bout he envisioned was curling.

My new girlfriend's outstanding appeal
Is her earthiness. Man, she's for real!
She'll be treating my folks
To some off-color jokes.
Dad will laugh till he chokes; Mom will squeal.

My complete lack of skills I take flak on,
And to that "old as dust" you can tack on.
And a college degree?
I don't need one, you see,
Since I still have my looks to fall back on.

The ore copper pyrites: a swarm
In large outcrops we find is the norm.
CuFeS2
Is the way that we view
Its tetragonal crystalline form.

A sweet maiden has come to some grief
At the hand of a Fieldingesque thief.
Using feasting and bawdry,
The scoundrel has Audrey
Turning over a naughty new leaf.

"Why won't overseas people agree
To use miles, pints, and pounds just like me?"
Globaloney like this
You might lightly dismiss,
But it's rarely that easy to see.

Very chic? I would never have guessed
Faux-antique to be thought of as best.
Pristine lumber is marred,
Burned, disfigured, and scarred,
To create the motif called distressed.

Having forethought means planning ahead,
Like in making a hand-woven spread:
I've got fibers spun tight.
If I don't prepare right,
All the threads on the bedspread may shred.

There's many a sequence of three
From the alphabet like ADC,
But I fear that without
Knowing what they're about,
They're no more than linguistic debris.

"Your relationship's losing its fizz?"
Asked my mom, a buttinsky.   It is,
But she constantly peddles
Advice as she meddles.
I told her, "Mom, none of your biz."

Night oarsmen in water. A strand.
Ashore, ten, I'm warranting, stand.
Here, they have no old rope,
Or they'd leave her no hope:
Their anagram's written on sand.

He never shuts up—I can't bear it!
His garrulity's lethal, I swear it.
He yaps on and on
'Til my sanity's gone.
I've had pleasanter chats with a parrot.

Aguascalientes, you say?
The wine-rich resort town? No way!
You may not take my daughter.
Though its name means "hot water,"
Just take a cold shower, okay?

We must get the job done by the end date,
Or that date we will call "lost-a-friend date".
Not a do-what-you-can date —
An absolute mandate!
It's an end date our friend can't extend date.

The Arabic alphabet's read
Right to left (Roman's left-right, instead).
The part I forget is
Its actual letters—
Their numerals, I have in my head.

"For our lovemaking plans to succeed,
Interference from punks we don't need.
Such an ill-mannered youth
Is your son—so uncouth!
He's a blot on the landscape, indeed."

There's my nuclear family, then cousins
And aunties, then uncles. The buzzin's
Real fierce when we meet
(Grab a plate, find a seat!)
All my calabash folks, by the dozens!

Last night, we'd a row.  Come the dawn,
My possessions, I noticed, were gone
From the house.  Seems my wife
Wants me out of her life
Bag and baggage.  My stuff's on the lawn.

"So you think Frank is funny," said Ma,
"Funny peculiar or funny ha-ha?"
"He's got quirks — and they're numerous.
Jokes? Always humorous.
Both, I would say," answered Pa.

Do breeders feel dark-of-night guilts
For the feathery twists, twirls and tilts
On a pantomime goose?
It was bred for one use:
Adding loft to fine pillows and quilts.

Proverbial phrases (called bywords)
Overused may decay into dry words.
But a limerick can play
At the language buffet,
With an em dash of mustard on rye words.

It is written 'the end' (can't say when),
'Will be here in a hundred or ten
Thousand years, thereabout'.
As I'm no way devout,
Armageddon on out before then.

The subject I'm planning to write on
Is the neuron's cell body—the cyton.
Think it's dull? That remark
Shows you're still in the dark,
As without it, we can't turn a light on.

Pick the target; you'll want to select
One that's personal.  Then be direct
As you chide and deride.
You will win to your side
Many people who want to defect.

Being tenderly young or quite old;
Letting wind, rain or sleet take a hold:
In our lives, these detractors
Are contributory factors
In catching a cough or a cold.

"It is freedom," said Ben, "that I want
From my master," and so, nonchalant,
He strolled off the plantation
And crossed our great nation.
Now this contraband lives in Vermont.

With a neck not as long as a swan's,
These large birds often populate ponds.
If you're living nearby,
You'll have reason to cry
When wild geese use your land for their johns.

Would apnoea be repetition,
As we've apnea done, in this mission?
Since it could lead to death,
Better not hold your breath
While you wait for a new definition.

When a journalist says he's embedded,
You're likely to know where he's headed:
He's looking for scoops
As he stays with the troops,
Saying prayers that his unit's not shredded.

Taking Caduet daily, I know
My cholesterol levels are low.
Made by Pfizer, it's new—
Not just one drug, but two!
It's a modern-day medicine show.

I testified one day in court,
Where I gave an earwitness report:
"What I heard weren't the cries
Right before someone dies;
They were more of the sexual sort."

So you're suffering aches in your gut?
Well, the cause may be hard to rebut.
Your large appetite's blamed.
With gastralgia you're shamed.
(Til it goes, maybe keep your mouth shut!)

The flight went according to plan:
The Eagle had landed on "Tran".
With the earth shining high
In the cold lunar sky,
Neil Armstrong took "One step for man".

Because fellows at Ford, a fair company,
Reject many cars, but don't dump any,
Crooks artfully lodge 'em
At fairgrounds (think "dodgem"),
Then warn all the kids not to bump any.

I've decided to fill up my Jag full
Of petrol to go for a drag, full
Of woe that the car
Didn't get very far
On the coal I'd put in by the bagful.

Kevin Phelps plays in goal for United,
But each game he appears in is blighted.
Be it cross, chip or shot,
Clueless Kev drops the lot—
Loves the game, but it's love unrequited.

In his charley-ken (watch-box), the sentry
Is alert to each exit and entry,
The comings and goings
And to-ings and fro-ings
Alike, of both peasants and gentry.

"Thar she blows!" Cap'n cried, with elation.
"Largest creature, bar none, in creation."
As the whalewatchers cheered,
The leviathan neared,
And they heard Cap's cetacean citation.

"Uncle Walt earned his salt selling bennies.
Now rubbed out, the guy sleeps with the blennies."
"Did he leave a  bequest?"
Asked my mom. I confessed:
"He left fourpence—that's four English pennies."

I know I neglected to call yez,
So here is a heap of fine dahlias.
Some are yellow, some red,
Some as big as my head.
Come on up! There are plenny for all yez.

Though the cold in his head made him blue,
He decided he knew what to do,
And he blew his nose gently,
Observing intently
The air as it cleared a way through.

You'll find blockwork enclosing shop stalls
And garages and buildings and malls.
Leave it plain; face with brick —
Its construction is quick —
Pre-cast concrete or cinderblock walls.

Real essential (you bet!), an agenda
Lists the things that you gotta attend ta.
You can check one by one
To make sure they get done—
Or ignore 'em and go on a benda.

Certain mutts have perennial blues,
Soulful bloodhounds with pendulous flews
Drooping south from the lip
In perpetual drip,
And sad eyes I could never refuse.

In the universe, youthful locality
Serves us a puzzle: causality.
Given all that we know,
Normal light is too slow
To explain our consistent reality.

From the very beginning you've seen
Ab initio.  What does it mean?
When you then reach the end
You may well comprehend
"At the start" has been lodged in your bean.

"Jumbo olives turn out to be small,
While the short cup at Starbucks is tall.
And those car rental deals
Drive me mental," he squeals,
"'Cause the mid-size ain't mid-sized at all."

Owls' ears are designed to perfection
For the subtlest rustle's detection,
As the shapes 'round their eyes,
Asymmetric in size,
Have evolved parabolic reflection.

BHA in the food that we buy
Preserves many a cookie and pie,
Or we'll use BHT,
But beware BHC—
It's insecticide; eat it—you die.

A dicast would not have a grudge
About letters that forced him to trudge
To a courthouse as juror.
Our lot is much poorer:
He wasn't just jury, but judge.

Said the peach to the almond, "How come
Our fine genus gets lumped with the plum?
The Prunus are plain,
While Amygdalus reign
As superior. Why should we slum?"

Should one wish to engallant a man,
Make him chivalrous.  Here is the plan:
To become a gallant,
Assist those — say, one's aunt —
Who are damsels distressed, when one can.

Our Mary writes briefs that are weighty,
And with college professors she's matey.
She's been asked for advice
By the Pope once or twice.
She is quite able-minded for 80.

Since my Labrador pup (twenty-ouncer)
Put on weight, he's not much of a pouncer.
In the porch, he'll just sit,
Choosing whom to admit:
"Labradoorman", we call him, and "Bouncer".

"Where's your brother?" Mom asked at the table.
"I dunno, Ma. You checked by the stable?"
"Cain, account for his whereabouts!"
"Try Egypt or thereabouts.
The exact place? Can't say—I'm not Abel."

Coprolitic remains undergird
Archaeology—much is inferred.
From these fossils we know
About man long ago.
Oh, the tales that are told by the turd!

The old tramp looks away, but the pain
Of rejection will stick, and remain
With him always. Unkempt,
He absorbs the contempt
In their glances of utter disdain.

You're a moron—a nitwit—a boob.
And that question you asked? What a rube!
"What's Danubian?" Gee,
That seems easy to me:
It means "bordering on the Danube."

Dermovascular action's the flow
Of the blood in the vessels that go
Out to nourish the skin
From deep pumping within,
So my toes warmly glow in the snow.

As if using an adze were not pure enough,
And spelling it adz weren't obscure enough,
A fellow named Gaddis
Would call it his addice.
A triple archaism, sure enough.

I'm invited to dine with the Towles.
After dinner, my abdomen growls.
Their intent, now I see,
Is to constipate me—
That means slowing or stopping my bowels.

My command-driven program is cool
As it waits on response from a fool:
"Please provide SSN
And your bank pin" (and then
I'll clean out  your accounts with this tool).

The word fulminant ("sudden, severe")
Well described the sharp pain in my ear
When our darling, young Fred,
While asleep in our bed,
Turned and flailed with an elbow — the dear!

This hombre's cool gaze knows no fear.
He lunges — a gasp, then a cheer.
Now el toro's just meat
And the crowd's on its feet
For the matador. And a loose ear.

I've reached my old age when I find
That my body is creaking; my mind
Is—well—absent. So, please—
It's "old-timer's disease".
Show some patience with me and my kind.

Arrhenius knew a reaction
Would hasten if heated a fraction.
"I deduce some relation
With E-activation,"
He said, with profound satisfaction.

A hot Catalan gal named Louise
Was so powerfully sprung 'twixt her knees
That one carnal convulsion
Contained such propulsion
Her boyfriend was launched to Cádiz.

Acidimetric equipment can show
Us the strength of an acid, just so,
With a measure exact
That is based on hard fact,
So we don't need no litmus no mo'.

Between meals, there's a tedious span
That I shorten, according to plan,
With a bever (or snack)
Of gazpacho or yak
Or some cheese that I spray from a can.

The taxman delightedly gloats
As he scribbles down sums in his notes:
"Even Baywatch beach beauties
Still have to pay duties.
Active assets? Their costumes and floats."

The savage young Beatles could play
A whole album of hits in a day.
Please Please Me still pleases
The lads and their squeezes
In Liverpool, oop round are way.

Our wordsmith, Philology Pete,
Sold adjectives, too, for a treat.
From calm to excited
And bored to delighted,
These words help make writing complete.

In the Alps, lived a foundling so sad,
'Til one day, came a woman, said, "Lad,
Don't you recognize me?
I'm your ma, can't you see?"
"Yodeladyhoo married my dad?"

Keeping rabbits for table's a lark,
But they nibble by day and by dark.
I can never afford
That my deer share the sward,
So I'll send them abroad (disimpark).

Millie Phelps loves champagne, and she's thrilled
When her glass is both full and well chilled.
If the temperature's off,
The cool lady will scoff—
And she hates it when something gets spilled.

You talk of my excess of mass
Using heavy or fat.  That's too crass.
When discussing my weight,
I'd prefer that you state
I've great avoirdupois.  Show some class.

Look at Vega or Deneb with care,
And then Sirius. What do they share?
They're the same spectral class.
If you know it, you'll pass
With grade A like these stars, I declare!

Barbados—Caribbean isle!
A place to vacation in style.
It's also a nation
(For your information),
And'll probably be for a while.

Her worn face told a punishing tale:
An absumed look, eroded and pale.
She'd held troubles inside,
First consumed then denied,
But her eyes showed her hopelessly frail.

The antennule will flick to and fro
On a lobster, thus letting it know
What's up in the water.
That aerial oughter
Get channels like H2BO.

She kept moving around—like a drifter;
Sam agreed from that lifestyle he'd lift her,
But her plan is a sham,
And she's pulling a scam.
Soon she'll scram; darling Pam is a grifter.

For his sexist remarks, Uncle Bert
Has been ordered to work in a skirt.
Of his penance, says he,
"It don't matter to me,
But the cut in my paycheck does hurt."

My baccalaureate degree's what I prize,
For the knowledge and skill it implies.
So smart I seem alien,
I'm sesquipedalian,
And erudite, learned, and wise.

These "boy singers" have all looked the same:
Tousled hair, the right clothes — that's the game.
Now he comes down the pike
With his pointy vandyke.
Of course, he can't sing — what a shame!

"When I nap after lunch," explained Rose,
"I don't sleep very deeply; I doze.
I am easy to wake,
So shut up for God's sake,
And keep still when you see my eyes close."

Got a show business dream? Then determine
If your chest voice is strong; I'm affirmin'
If you belt high and long
And can sell a show song,
You belong right along Ethel Merman.

"Take it easy, now, Skip. Keep it real.
Please don't vent the emotions you feel.
Just calm down. Breathe out slow.
Let disturbing thoughts go,
And then go with the flow, even keel."

"Where is Abel?" God asks. "I don't know.
Do I need to keep track of my bro?
Is his welfare," asks Cain,
"My concern?" (He was slain
By Cain's hand, and God knew it. Uh-oh!)

Not since great-grandpa Jack was last seen,
Was a redhead with limbs long and lean
Related to us,
Atavistically thus;
My brother has Jack's build and mien.

My blood sugar's high elevation
Reflected a bad situation.
My urine was sweet
Since my pancreas, beat,
Had decided to take a vacation.

Aphrodite's renowned sweet patootie
Was Adonis, the symbol of beauty
Of the masculine kind
(I have rugged in mind):
Very virile, not fruity, this cutie.

Tipper rushed to the video store
With a deathly strong yearning to score
Something horribly thrilling
With torture and killing
And bloodiness (plenty of gore).

In Beijing, people speak Pekingese—
To the south, in Guangzhou, Cantonese.
Though the difference is clear
To the Mandarin ear,
For all I know, they're both Siamese!

Seems I'm shirking, so slow baling hay,
But the farmer says, "No, that's fair play.
It's a back-breaking feat
In this terrible heat.
And Rome wasn't built in a day."

I spend most of my birthdays abroad,
So that Time I can somehow defraud.
Far from home, years don't mount,
So a birthday won't count...
I suspect that this logic is flawed.

Do our rulers have ethical health?
No, they're mostly old geezers with wealth.
Was chrysocracy bred
In democracy's bed?
Were we sleeping? Or did they use stealth?

This triple-cream cheese, I submit,
With its sweet, nutty taste, is a hit.
Though the product's named Finn,
Since it's wholly made in
The U.K. they should call this stuff Brit.

Be it strongly or weakly anthropic,
This principle's quite a hot topic:
Any great TOE
That negates you and me
(Since we're here) clearly must be myopic.

My uncle got sick 'cause he smoked.
Emphysemic, he gasped, wheezed and choked.
Still, when crossing Death's door,
He looked sixty, no more.
(He was forty years old when he croaked.)

You've a short (euryprosopic-type) face,
While mine's long.  Let me cut to the chase:
With mine leptoprosopic,
Osculation's my topic:
Whose lips are the ones out of place?

A black swan ruled our waters today,
Having skied in on hisses of spray.
Back and forth he swept by
With his regal head high,
Antimonarchist me in his sway.

In a quest to become photogenic,
She's practicing moves calisthenic.
But jumping like Jack
She's twisted her back,
And suffered a rupture that's splenic.

There was once a Greek geezer named Aesop
Who loved talking the birds and the bees up.
Said a youth, "Act your age!"
"You mean senile, or sage?
I will make all the fables I please up!"

Norway's aphrizites — black tourmalines —
"Frozen foam" must be what the term means:
Scandinavian froth
Goddess-pretty and goth,
Hard-to-score, yet attached to wild scenes.

Eve's action appeared injudicious,
Considered by some as pernicious.
With guilt she was ridden;
The fruit was forbidden.
That apple, though—oh, how delicious!

An intense theologian named Barth
Thought of God in the hush of a garth—
This cortile, he'd say,
Gave him comfort by day
So at night he could pray by the hearth.

A hot drink much desired by our vicar,
Being somewhat like cocoa but thicker,
Is a dark chocolate brew,
Rather bittersweet too,
Based on cocoa nib paste—chocolate liquor.

Some reforms cause political storms,
Thus upsetting free enterprise norms.
CCF taught its group
All the socialist poop—
Education takes multiple forms.

Sympathetic accelerans nerve,
Is my heart (and my blood) what you serve?
Or are you my heart's master,
Getting blood pumping faster
Whenever I see a girl's curve?

Tongue on fire, and it hurts me a lot!
It's all burning, so hot, what I got!
Kapow! SHUs!
Got the chili pepper blues —
All my nerves, all my taste buds are shot!

I'll admit I'm a poor lexicographer
And I'm nobody's cinematographer;
I'm content with my prints
And their layers of tints.
I'm your neighbourhood chromolithographer.

Said the millionaire, "I'd never steal,"
But I watched as he cadged a free meal.
Then he took some gal's beer,
Saying, "Thanks, you're a dear."
What a cheapskate! Is this guy for real?

You're complaining from morning to night:
First your room, now the food isn't right.
You sound quite beyond hope,
But the rest of us cope.
Just get over yourself and your 'plight'.

Cold water! That's what has been thrown
On my plans for a flat of my own
When I summer downtown
In old London.  A frown
From my papa: "No living alone."

An action game may feature fighting,
Or the stealing of cars (how exciting!),
Or war scenes chaotic,
Or monsters psychotic.
I don't find this B.S. inviting.

Of all of the job titles yet,
What's the worst sounding? Cow leech, I'd bet.
Did they suck blood from cattle?
No way. I'd say that'll
Be just an old name for a vet.

I should so like to give you a kiss.
Would you kindly facilitate this?
It would be so much easier
(Although you'd be freezier)
If that scarf round your face you'd dismiss.

Let's agree to this one truth, at least:
It was canicross slaughtered the beast.
With me harnessed behind,
His poor heart just resigned.
Now my malamute's clearly deceased.

When the feverish dengue receiver
Detached all his limbs with a cleaver,
He said, "I've removed
All the pain, which has proved
That disarming relieves breakbone fever!"

Winona the millipede knew
The quinone she'd secreted on you
Would dissuade you from eating her:
Nothing was beating her
Millipede kill-impede brew.

He was cheerful and pleased with his life.
She was angry and pulled out a knife.
Though the late aforementioned
Was quite well intentioned;
That couldn't be said of his wife.

These everyday loafers of mine
Are the kind I don't bother to shine.
They're for trips to the store
And for walks on the shore.
Though not fancy, I like 'em just fine.

Raise a glass to the hardy archaea.
Some subsist (You ask how? No idea.)
On the sulfur that's sent
Through a hot deep-sea vent.
For myself, I prefer a tortilla.

I am bullheaded, biased—what's worse—
I am wrongheaded, headstrong, perverse.
I am pigheaded, mulish,
So dogged I'm foolish;
I'm stubborn—but not very terse.

The judgment against you was gross.
You were watchin' illegals, real close.
Gonna grant you a pardon
'Fore your arteries harden.
Good-bye Joe, you can go. Adios!

When King Henry the Fifth learned to weave, he
Made robes with a forty-inch sleeve. He
Was warned by his man:
"When you're using the can,
Your sleeve will be sloshing in pee, V."

Though a full-blooded Cherokee brave,
Soaring Eagle insists, "Call me Dave."
He's an apple, all right,
Trying hard to be white.
His proud father must spin in his grave.

"Hey, Mom, I've a chance at my dream —
The X-treme Harley Acrobats Team!"
She frowned at me, scaring
Me out of my daring:
She eyebrowed me out of my scheme.

Why, you bloodthirsty beast, are you hopin'
That killin's a good way of copin'?
Then eventerate me;
Cut me up and you'll see.
Come eviscerate me, rip me open.

You declare that you'd like a critique
Of your highly developed physique.
Well, your buff, sculpted torso
Would appear even more so
With a larger external oblique.

Are you down on your uppers of late?
Is your piggy bank way underweight?
Are you penniless, dragging?
(Forgive me my nagging.)
Still, there's hope for a lad of but eight.

Ping Bodie, now 50 years dead,
Is recalled for just one thing he said:
"I do not room with Ruth,"
He remarked. "It's the truth.
I just room with his suitcase instead."

In the land of my ancestors' birth,
Where there's beauty and music and mirth,
There's a small sandy shore
That I'll always adore:
Aberdaron — the best place on Earth.

 

How can one brighten one's torpor and tedium?
