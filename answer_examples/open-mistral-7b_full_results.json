The phrase \"autogiro\" in the limerick refers to a cartel of aircraft that did the last drop, a half-plane and half-chopper. The limerick does not mention anything about a building with 59 floors or a man named Rock. Therefore, the question \"What's Rock going to get?\" cannot be answered based on the given limericks.",
