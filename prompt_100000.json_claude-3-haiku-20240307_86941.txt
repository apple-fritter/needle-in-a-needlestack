This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.

My life was unhinged and bourgeois,
So I turned to my roots, et voila!,
I grew out my beard
And Torah I revered,
Becoming baal teshuva.

Since her recent divorce, my aunt Min
Has had wrinkles appear in her skin.
She is no longer bold;
She's grown suddenly old,
Looking careworn, unhappy and thin.

The Agonyclites stood when they prayed,
Leaving others disturbed and dismayed.
The authorities felt
That they ought to have knelt,
And I think that they should have obeyed.

To compose a morose epicedium
Can brighten one's torpor and tedium.
I myself have an urge
To create a sad dirge —
One not overly mournful, just medium.

When making Canadian law,
The parliamentarians jaw—
And they may take all night,
If they happen to fight
With the ones from the Bloc Québécois.

When the butler is sounding the gong,
See their dinner gowns, slinky and long.
But when ladies depart,
Then the menfolk will start
To make bets on who's wearing a thong.

Send a cover sheet out with your fax
So it won't simply fall through the cracks.
List the issues involved
And we'll see they're resolved—
Basic facts, not the whole ball of wax.

While flipping a hamburger patty,
Poor Mitzi went quietly batty —
Said, "French fries with that?"
As she deep-fried a rat.
"There's no difference; it all ends up fatty."

I've decided to learn how to bake
And, unshaken, I'm planning to make
My first try as a rookie
A chocolate chip cookie,
Before I attempt chocolate cake.

People's sex lives can shock and appall.
Oh, it's strange all the things that enthrall.
Chains and whips, leather chaps,
But the weirdest, perhaps:
Aphallatia — no sex at all.

When deciding to lend you some cash,
Bankers never are hasty or rash.
They apply credit scoring
(A term that sounds boring)
To decide if you're trusty or trash.

The gambler, brow knit in a frown,
Watched his faro chip assets go down.
"This is rigged, so they say,
But I still have to play.
It's the only game left in this town."

Jake got caught with those hubcaps he steals.
Now he sits in jail cooling his heels—
Not the best of careers.
He'll serve one to two years,
'Less his lawyer can file some appeals.

This puss was abandoned, James knew,
And a stray takes a risk near a zoo,
So he whispered, "Here, kitty,"
And held out, from pity,
A hand — but the tiger took two.

An adept aquafortist named Dave
Using acid would etch and engrave.
One foul day, a bad leak
Saw some splash on his cheek.
He survived, though—a very close shave.

If you're hearing-impaired, no apology
Is required; consult the anthology
Of professions for one
That tests hearing — it's done
By those licensed to do audiology.

There oughta be some kind of law
When the gals in the office all jaw
About babies.  Obsessing,
They're always expressing
Delight with that sugary "Awwwww!"

We're direct-grant schools. Note, if you please,
Being frightfully posh, we charge fees,
But we tolerate proles
(Just a few) on our rolls,
'Cause the government pays us for these.

We're anarchists (rules will appall us),
Yet we dress with a smartness that's flawless.
We're tailored discreetly
And matched quite completely:
We needn't be slobs to be lawless.

Haunted houses are best viewed by night,
When there's not one sane person in sight.
If gales blow while it rains
And ghosts rattle their chains,
Then they're sure to deliver a fright.

It's that roll in his gait, you'll agree,
His white ducks and distaste for debris:
Since he crawled from the crib,
By the cut of his jib,
It's been clear that his true home's the sea.

There's a pigment that's yellowish-brown
For which bister's the relevant noun—
And it's bistered you get
When you soak it, and let
Jackson Pollock start going to town.

The first antidetonant, lead,
Did horrible things as it spread
From our cars to our plains,
Into little kids' brains.
Now we use safer octanes instead.

"From the left, take a fist," I declare,
As your punch hits from right.  Oh, despair.
That chiasmus up there
Has a pattern — just stare;
It's a cross that I'm sure you can bear.

You'd think nothing could make a man sadder
Than having a full, sloshy bladder,
Legs crossed at the knee
'Cause he's so full of pee —
Then the sprinklers start, making him madder.

A long parting again must be faced.
Hugging tightly, they fiercely embraced;
Every clasp in the past
Has proved fast love can last
When on friendship and loyalty based.

I said, "Joe, Daddy thinks that you're drony,
And I'm sure he believes you're a phony
With a proneness to shirk,
And allergic to work."
Joe was irked, and he bellowed: "Baloney!"

In two seconds, a setting's erased.
With a clock wipe, the scene is replaced:
Second hand sweeps around
And the film's on new ground—
Gives a place change an odd, vintage taste.

Some folks might think cranberry glass
Is for fruit of the cranberry class.
But it's glass of deep red,
With a gold sheen, and said
To be sought by the English top brass.

With chloramine we can be sure
That a potable state will endure
In the water we drink,
For we'd all like to think
That what flows from the tap's clean and pure.

Invitations don't always invite;
Dinner parties are often a fright.
Let the host mutter, "Weasels!"
We'll say we've got measles
And dine in, my darling, tonight.

While you went for a weekend to Rome,
Your new washer spat masses of foam.
It smothered the floor,
Barely dammed by the door:
You will need antifoam when you're home.

The devil produces a spark
Of power for spells in the dark.
Black arts are espoused
By people like Faust
Who bargain their souls for a lark.

In limerick writing, your meter
Is anapest.  Would it be neater
Wedding iamb and trochee?
That's not okey-dokey!
Use antispast?  Never, you cheater!

You amaze me, my dear Mr. Fox,
When you lift up that mountain of rocks.
I'm astounded and awed,
And I'm barefoot, by Gawd,
For your prowess has knocked off my socks.

My anesthesiologist, Jill,
Has a useful and wonderful skill.
She will keep you pain-free
Through your surgery, see—
But just wait till she sends you her bill.

Country mile: that's a long way to go?
All us hicks in the sticks would say no.
In Chicago, a mile
Takes an hour (what a trial!)—
Around here, just a minute or so.

An ultrasound scan can detect
Venous flow, by the Doppler effect.
It will show if you've got
A vein blocked by a clot
When a DVT's what to suspect.

Said I, to the database lass,
"Your server's become a morass.
Your front-end is fine
(Handles better than mine),
But your back-end's a pain in the ass."

For most 'bee stings' the bees take the fall,
Though it isn't the bees' fault at all;
Vespine pests, yellow jackets
Undertake an attack; it's
A typical day's ER call.

With amazingly great gifts I'll ply you:
First to Normandy, France I will fly you.
Next, a New Orleans creek
I will mail you next week.
Yes, that's Bayou Bayeux I will buy you.

Fumed a bee with a flap of its wing,
"We can't gather up pollen or sting!
Something's clogged our corbiculae,
Soddened our spiculae:
Rain is a terrible thing!"

At a wedding reception in Cana,
The dear bride was a beauty, a sheyna,
And one guest was so fine
He turned water to wine
And the groom to a former abstainer.

Amarantaceous indeed!
Common "pig" is the name of this weed.
Those sesquipedalian
Words are so alien;
Smart Alecs ain't what we need.

When you come to our marshmallow store,
You'll find oil drums of Fluff on the floor.
We found barrels no good,
Since the slivers from wood
Prompted negligence lawsuits galore.

On those far rolling hills they're still farming;
This countryside view is so charming.
But on turning my head
I see townscapes instead,
And the rate of their spread is alarming.

To my fans, I admit my indebtedness;
Having failed them, I feel a regrettedness
That my Broadway career's
Disappeared—no more cheers.
It's gone foul, with malodorous fetidness.

Your dementia evolves by degrees,
As your brain's forming holes like Swiss cheese.
Now you firmly avow
That you suffer "mad cow",
Though you've caught Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

This delusion I have of negation
Is a matter of utmost frustration
To those who agree
That there is a world. Me?
I just know it's a long-dead location.

There's a break in line 5 of this verse,
A short tale of a murderous nurse.
I had come to her ward
For some warts I'd ignored,
But went home the next day…             in a hearse!

Sure, an octopus might use a tool,
But some trivia even more cool?
A consortium's when
There's a lot more than ten.
I suppose they're too smart for a school.

Acinetiform's not what I'm called.
Such a thought has me quite unenthralled,
Since I'm neither suctorial,
Nor at all infusorial
And by matter decayed I'm appalled.

I know you won't find me pedantic
When I tell you this beetle's gigantic.
It measures six inches;
With "horns," the bug pinches.
Why do schoolgirls find beetles romantic?

Dancing farandoles earned us some praise:
Threading Needles, escaping The Maze.
Our footing was certain,
Our clothing was curtain;
St Sepulchres: those were the days.

One would hope, in a crisis, benevolence
Would be the response that takes prevalence.
But alas, we have seen
People tend to be mean,
And delight in their senseless malevolence.

Said the teacher, "Use all of your brain —
How much sand will this basin contain?"
The class scratched its head,
'Til one genius said:
"A basinful, sir, it is plain."

Two lessons were learned from the strife
That was faced by George Bailey and wife.
One: an angel earns wings
Every time a bell rings,
And then two: it's a wonderful life.

Veggies strewn on a plate like confetti
Are brunoise.  The chef got them ready
By dicing real fine
(One-eighth inch is divine)
While she's keeping her knife sharp and steady.

Good Samaritan laws can protect you
From lawsuits you fear might deflect you
From helping a stranger
Who's facing a danger.
The courts will (correctly) respect you.

"Has the Girdle of Venus been banned
From all stores? I just don't understand.
I've looked high, I've looked low—"
"Further search please forgo.
It's right there in the palm of your hand."

From our duck-hunting, home via Daniel's.
He said, "Bring some deodorant granules
Next time out, for that fug —
Rotting rug — makes me chug."
That's the trouble with wet cocker spaniels.

A creationist posits the cause
Of all life that on Earth ever was
Must be God, because life
Begets life; now it's rife
And complies with its Prime Mover's laws.

Drawings, diagrammatically sound,
That plot out the lie of the ground
(Landscape plans, with no hues,
Flat, cross-sectional views),
Stir no joy in my soul, I have found.

"Listen, boys," said field officer Joe
To the sergeants, lieutenants (below
His own major's rank) "we
Will capture this tank. We
Will deal all these devils a blow".

We've got C-rations, some fit to eat,
With their tins of unspecified meat
(Which some claim is wombat.
But hell, this is combat),
And coffee and fudge. Ain't that sweet!

When an actor attempting a leap
Missed his mark and fell into a heap,
The censor (God love her)
His mouth could not cover,
But hid his loud curses with BLEEEEEEP.

An enantiomorphic connection
Resembles a mirror's reflection.
The form of the first
Is the second, reversed.
You've a pair close at hand for inspection.

Would the Democrats find it a blessing
If their two top contenders stopped pressing
To be first and became
A merged team with one aim—
C-and-O,  their best skills coalescing?

Vacationing, I shall make hay,
And service my joy, come what may,
As I coin verbs denominative
To show I'm predominative
And leverage my MBA.

Having stop, cease, desist on their mind,
Pirate captains might say, you will find,
"Avast behind!" This
Could be taken amiss
By their crews, who could think them unkind!

While prowling his base's perimeter
Major Tom wore his medals and scimitar.
When he shouted, "Jump to it!"
Troops knew to construe it
As "high 'nuff to need an altimeter."

When the Pinto arrived at my station,
It suffered from poor carburetion.
I started to fix
The gas/oxygen mix
But got high from the fuel's emanation.

On the beaches of Puerto Vallarta
Are Canadians; Greeks live in Sparta;
And in Java, the Dutch
Don't do anything much,
Except ask you the way to Batavia.

She's been out for a night on the tiles;
Staggers home, sees the phone, and drunk dials—
"You can keep your damned bitch,
But I'll sue, and be rich.
And your 'son'? Well, here's news, hon. He's Lyall's."

Ammodramus, a genus of sparrows,
Features several with tails sharp as arrows.
From the fens where they skulk
They eat grass seeds in bulk
And snatch bugs by the dawn and dusk scarrows.

"But he got fewer votes!"—that's your spin
When you call into question his win.
But contest all you will.
Will you protest until
The electoral loser gets in?

From its blossoms, a lovely perfume
Fills the air when this vine is in bloom.
Chilean jasmine is fine
In a garden like mine;
Brought inside it brings scent to each room.

What's a chaetopod? That is a term
That's applied to an annelid worm,
As its bristle, or seta,
Is known as a chaeta.
These beasties can make people squirm.

"I was walking along when my skin
Started dripping right off of my chin,
Till my whole epidermis
Filled a two gallon thermos!"
Is a lie this dermatic a sin?

My Chemistry grade's a disgrace.
The compound they gave me to trace
As my final exam
Was an ampholyte; damn!
I just couldn't tell: acid or base?

The last boat floats away from the shore.
Now I wish I had boarded before,
But I couldn't decide.
Was it sloth?  Was it pride?
Does it matter at all anymore?

I have an old burro named Jo
Who is cranky, obnoxious, and slow.
Still she's such a sweet ass,
So I travelled to Mass.
And I married her, loving her so.

The waterscape, ebbing and swelling —
Mesmeric, engrossing, dispelling
All thoughts from your mind
As your daydreams unwind —
Is hypnotic, alluring, compelling.

"Our best suspect, I've learned, has a twin,"
Said the chief, with a look of chagrin.
"He'll try some kind of switch,
So be sure which is which.
In your search for him, factor it in."

The first book review! (Yes, my first book,
Which I wrote on some gobbledygook!)
I was proud, man, but then
Read the text once again—
The reviewer, I found, was a schnook.

All the audience shouted "Right on!"
When shrewd Newt tried his media con.
Some feel he berated
Poor Williams. Not sated,
He teed off; scored a clean hole in Juan.

In the late 1800s they came,
Profiteers—from old settlers to claim,
In the wake of lost war,
The spoils, legal, and more,
And today they're still doing the same.

When my  brother and I built our den
(I'd be six-and-a-half; he'd be ten)
In that bracken-clad ditch,
We felt safe; we felt rich
And as happy as pigs in a pen.

My blonde wife is impressive in height,
And her beer mug's an everyday sight.
She appears German-looking
While sauerkraut-cooking,
But was born on our own Isle of Wight.

I get lost from the den to the loo;
Once arrived, I've no clue what to do.
My confusional state
Means I'm usually late
For appointments… except those with you.

The captain, face pale, turned to me.
"Here, use this bailing out this huge sea!"
"Captain, give me a pail
If you want me to bail.
This spoon's not for sea, it's for tea!"

It's wonderful stuff, cotton waste,
For cleaning machines (not in haste).
It soaks up the oil
Without too much toil,
But its downside has got to be faced.

If you can't find a purpose in life,
And you yearn for the noose or the knife,
Your unrest is anomic
And seriocomic:
You're living in Scotland in Fife.

Congregationalism's a sect;
All adherents, in Christ, are elect.
Each self-governing church
Sits alone on its perch;
Popes and bishops they roundly reject.

As he's hurrying past on the boat,
She's aware of the brush of his coat.
With the contact, this miss
Now imagines his kiss,
And she stifles a gasp in her throat.

A pessimist sadly conceded
His hairline had sharply receded.
His wife is more bullish:
"What's left is quite fullish!"
To me, his head's bigger than needed.

"What? You plan to defang that large asp?"
I declared, feeling scared and agasp.
"Pulling fangs from a snake
Makes me quake. For God's sake,
If you do, keep a mighty firm grasp!"

The three women of 9 Chickweed Lane
All live lives that are far from mundane.
These three generations
Encourage flirtations.
(They often have sex on the brain.)

Any pipe—when a liquid goes through it—
Has a name that is hard to intuit.
Start with KAHN-dit. Sound stiff? Wrong?
Then switch to a diphthong:
Choose KAHN-doo-it, –dyoo-it, or –djoo-it.

When electing MPs, the UK
Has a fine democratical way:
It's 'one person, one vote'—
A good system, you'll note.
Every Briton has his or her say.

Although Deus is Latin for "God",
Why "in nomine Dei"? It's odd
That the Lord of dimensions
Can't banish declensions
Imposed by some ancient old sod.

What two states have a quirk that's the same:
Just one consonant sits in each name?
O, i, a can be found,
'Cause those vowels resound;
Not an e nor a u is to blame.

The old gent had been given the eye,
So he gave it the old college try.
But her come-on was phony,
Just bar dare baloney.
Pop's patient; he's still standing by.

With her lovers, my wife keeps in touch
Via letters and phone calls and such.
"The first thirty-nine
Weren't so bad," I'd opine,
"But this fortieth guy is too much!"

Jimmy Dean, though deceased, still lives on
In a song he co-wrote: "Big Bad John."
He made country hearts throb,
Gave a Muppet a job,
And sold sausage from here to Taiwan.

Acantho-'s from Greek and means "spine."
It's a prefix and helps to define
Plants with thorns/things vertebral
(Used by folks most cerebral),
And tree surgeons think it divine.

Arrhenius knew a reaction
Would hasten if heated a fraction.
"I deduce some relation
With E-activation,"
He said, with profound satisfaction.

When a catalogue's dubbed raisonné,
It's a Frenchified way you can say
Annotations exist,
In an index or list,
Of the works that will be on display.

Though this strip never had me in stitches,
Broom-Hilda fills one of those niches.
While not witty or striking,
She's good for those liking
Cigar-smoking, man-hungry witches.

There are granules of proteins right there,
In the outermost endosperm layer
Of a seed, and they're bound
To the vitamins found
In that place, but the chickens don't care.

"Kitchen countertop's cracked," said the critic.
So, in shopping for something granitic
That would cover the block
With pastel fine-grained rock,
I obtained and installed the aplitic.

Distasting (disliking) cars slow,
A snail bought a Jag at a show.
Painting S on each side,
He took off for a ride.
People cried, "Look at that S-car go!"

Both a flame and a year fade to ember.
Observe, at the end of December,
A word that's implying
The year's flame is dying
But burning enough to remember.

Aristarchus of Samos declared
Geocentrists had possibly erred.
When all's said and done,
Might we orbit the sun?
Is there infinite space? No one cared.

He thought that his words were acidic
When he lectured in south Chappaquiddick;
So right for that hour,
Being fresh, sharp and sour,
But in truth they were dull — just bromidic.

Threats in H-bomb-linked crises we got
Through the Cold War—mistrust was our lot.
Arms reductions by name
Were achieved all the same.
Ron and Gorbie stopped cold turning hot!

I cherished my pet axolotl;
I found him, one day, in a bottle.
I tugged on his tail...
"Oh no!" did I wail:
"I've rendered my lizard acaudal!"

Freedom's march by protestors was led
When Britain's democracy bled.
From my comfort zone why
Should I march? No, I'll try
Writing letters to broadsheets instead.

Though my dive shop resembles a dive,
I've got gear to keep divers alive.
No, I didn't invent it;
I sell, trade or rent it.
And I stock all you'll need to survive.

If fermented grain mash makes you frisky,
You need not think the age statement risky.
Take a 12-year-old Scotch,
Wait four years and then watch:
The result?  Still a 12-year-old whisky.

Determinists say what's contained
In this limerick's been preordained
By the fates or whatever,
No matter how clever
My wording or how I've been trained.

A - V - A - X - T - S - K - Y - R:
Out in Iceland, this cheese is a star.
While its flavor I'll praise,
Though I've tried to for days
I just cannot pronounce it so far.

Our color sarn't's wife is a nag,
And she scolds him and says he's a fag,
But he's always consoled
(What a sight to behold!)
When he leads us while bearing our flag.

There is nobody, penny-wise, wiser.
He could work as a scrimping adviser.
He's a demon for thrift.
Even words get short shrift:
No econo is spared by this miser.

He writes music that orchestras play,
And conducts in a calm, graceful way,
But I'd bet all my PEZ
That our maestro Boulez
Gets upset when they call him "boo-LAY."

This is you if you hew to the view
That we've screwed up the world that we knew.
There can be no repair.
Buy a gun, say a prayer.
Clearly chaos is coming.  We're  through!

When you heard that the owner was dead
You moved in to his home in his stead.
Now the new legal heir
Finds that you're living there,
An abator; you're blocking his tread.

The housekeeper's friend NH3
Keeps dwellings bacteria-free.
Germs leave me alone if I
Always ammonify,
And so do my in-laws — yippee!

See Cupid's swift arrows bestow
Wondrous love; they set hearts all aglow.
May he reach in his quiver
And surely deliver
His arrow from bow to your beau.

When Pete, on the cliffs of Peninnis,
Isles of Scilly, and drunk (too much Guinness),
Fell down from the rock,
It was more than a shock:
The end of it all, it was — finis.

My girl's ten, but she's going on teen —
Getting nearer to grown-up, I mean.
These days no one denies,
Thanks to Internet's rise,
Kids age quicker from screens heard and seen.

As a pig, I was nearly forsaken:
Without the blue ribbon, I'm bacon.
Charlotte did me up big,
In her web, spun "SOME PIG",
Saved my hide, but she left my heart achin'.

Oh, don't throw your toys out your pram!
Yes, I treat all your emails as spam.
Hurt your feelings? Don't care;
I don't like you, so there!
Just accept that I don't give a damn!

Arame (that's seaweed, to you)
Can be stir-fried to feed a whole crew.
As a side dish with fish,
Some will say it's delish,
But tonight I'd prefer a fondue.

It was over before it began.
I snuck out when he went to the can.
Though I never could date him,
I didn't berate him
For trying to pass as a man.

Princess, this was a poem for thee,
My anonymous, great addressee,
Who lets no rhyme or meter
Dismay or defeat 'er,
Composing ballades hassle-free.

Don't respond to the troll.  That will lead him
To forum abuse.  We don't need him
Disrupting our fun.
If you see his posts, run.
His one aim's to inflame, so don't feed him.

The cottonmouth's mouth is pure white.
It's a sight that fills swimmers with fright
'Cause this snake likes to swim,
And your future is grim
If this moccasin chooses to bite!

Cap crucifix clutter creation?
Peg Protestant prop population?
Trick-trending truth tramples,
So seek several samples—
A valuable cross-validation.

When a color's chromatic, they say
It's defined as "with hue." Well, OK...
It's "a color with hue"?
I reply, "Whoop-de-do!"
(What they mean is not black, white, or gray.)

Said Blanche, a despiser of Trump:
"When he tweets or he speaks on the stump,
He's asinus ad lyram —
He lies! We can't hire 'im!
I won't vote for an ass, I'm no chump!"

By e-mail, e-missives are sent,
With an e-philosophical bent.
E-clectic, they're cabled,
E-lectric e-nabled.
E-gad, they e-never relent!

The monarch's the role I've assumed;
The previous king has been doomed.
He was not labeled mean,
Neither base nor obscene,
But persistently shabbily groomed.

I will cobble a cobbler from scraps
You can gobble in bowls off your laps.
To this crusty meat dish
I'll add veg if you wish.
If you're good, there'll be seconds — perhaps.

If crystals should split as a prism
Not only with verticalism—
Horizontally too—
Diprismatic will do
To describe such a cleavage or schism.

An achenium's one kind of breed
Of a fruit about which you may read;
Indehiscent (no split),
Single-seeded, and it
Is so bare that it's called naked seed.

Miss World's need to pee never ceases,
Hence global awareness increases.
But she's somewhat dismayed,
Since her major crusade
Is not diuresis — world peace is.

It's at sunrise that reveille's blown
And the skills of the bugler are shown.
With no valves to rely on,
He's forced to get by on
One set of harmonics alone.

A linguaphile, she has collected
Words she likes and considers neglected.
I suggest that you look
At her marvelous book.
With the language bug you'll be infected.

'Twas brillig, where mome raths were mimsy,
For Carroll, the master of whimsy.
A slithy tove curls,
'He is dodgy with girls',
But such gimbling gyre is quite flimsy.

My mother and I had this fight;
And I know for a fact I am right!
I am not going back
'Til she cuts me some slack—
Can I crash on your sofa tonight?

Miss Long's letter, a lengthy epistle
(Sharply critical, pointed as thistle),
Made the editor blink:
No, it wouldn't see ink.
In a wink it was binned like old gristle.

All my equities, company stocks,
I would once keep locked up in a box:
Now financials like these
Are on line. It's a breeze
And as safe, so they say, as Fort Knox.

Basic chutney's a south-Asian relish
Of vegetables cooks will embellish
With chilies and spices.
The consequent price is
A chutney so hot that it's hellish.

In the old days, a guy could comprint.
It means print alongside; there's a hint
There of ties that will bind—
If you willingly signed
Your own name to another guy's stint.

A wee child puffs a dandelion head,
And its seeds are dispersed, widely spread.
From this same basic word,
A dispersal's occurred
When a shooting-range target is read.

"I ain't never bin aimin' to hurt you.
You know that I'd never desert you."
Clem's words were like honey,
But Daisy felt funny,
So still she hangs onto her virtue.

It's from one of my favorite plays:
In the bosom of Arthur he lays.
Thus Sir John met his death.
So declares in one breath
Mistress Quickly—she butchers the phrase.

"This tartly red cranberry's very
Delicious in sauces," said Kerry.
"It's perfect with turkey —
And urine that's murky.
It's such a darned versatile berry!"

Joseph Conrad was obviously brighter
Than others as sailor and fighter:
Of Polish descent,
He learned English and went
Through adventures in life and as writer.

Let's elasticize currency now.
We'll make bills out of rubber, I vow.
Though today people holler,
"I can't stretch a dollar,"
They could with this money, and how!

In voting, a long time ago,
A black ball implied "anti", not "pro";
So you blackball (reject
From a group or a sect)
When you ostracize someone you know.

"I've been dealt a bad hand, God.  I'm fat,
I'm not smart, and I'm one ugly cat."
"Lose some weight.  Read more books.
In regards to your looks,
Listen, Kevin.  I'm sorry 'bout that."

You are doing your prospects no good.
The results, to your detriment, could
Rather quickly arise,
So more tact I'd advise,
To avoid being misunderstood.

Across from the sun in the sky,
There's a counterglow, faint to the eye.
It's backscattered light
(Due to space dust) at night,
When it's dark and the weather is dry.

Don't you spray me with that — don't you dare!
I just came in this shop for some air.
Now I'm covered with scent
And I'm sorry I went
Past that stinky concession-(sniff)-aire.

You're respectable, so, Mr. Hunt,
Our scheme's failure means you take the brunt
Of the wrath from those cheated,
Whose funds we've depleted.
That's why you're set up as our front.

Blackpool Sands is a family beach,
With the showers and snacks all in reach
But hang on, and don't panic,
The food is organic,
And recycling is something they preach.

In stilettos this season's bespoke;
On a catwalk I strut before folk
Who don't buy off the peg.
Damn! I've not shaved one leg.
That's my cover blown! Yes, I'm a bloke.

"That barmaid called Mabel," said Bert,
"Is the sort what's as common as dirt:
A foul-mouthed young hussy,
Who ain't none too fussy—
That's what I calls 'a nice piece of skirt.'"

A dieter, feeling laconic,
Drank gulps of an acid dextronic.
When the syrup kicked in,
She decried, "It's a sin!
I'm addicted — it's true, and it's chronic."

It's a problem I've battled all winter.
It might be my toner or tinter.
With my email, oh please,
Help me send out cc's,
Since the carbons won't fit in my printer.

Bruce sniggered, "Jeez, mate—that was funny,
To see that I would have paid money.
Can you do it again?"
I said, "Shut up!" And then,
"Help me get myself out of this dunny."

A pattern of planes in the sky
Keeps its shape as they come roaring by.
The formation of jets
Always gives me the sweats —
In my dream I'm the pilots' bull's eye.

Your ignition switch suddenly froze?
Are the contact points clean? Do they close?
If they properly meet,
Then the circuit's complete,
And you'll find electricity flows.

My arms—they won't wave! They just keep
Kinda hanging—refusing to sweep!
They're no longer alive!
Call a medic!... Oh. I've
Only rolled on them during my sleep.

In a cave or a mine, there's no light;
It's the same when you're cycling at night.
Where it's cold, dark, and damp,
The antique carbide lamp
Burns a flame that's amazingly bright.

Ben's painting shows bare-naked trees
Bearing snow on their branches. One sees,
A short distance away,
A small horse and a sleigh.
His frost piece shows Frost expertise.

A strong building within and without,
It's a citadel, blockhouse, redoubt.
It's a place of a sort
That is known as a fort:
That's the structure I'm talking about.

My wife is re-doing, with wicker,
From our bed to the locker for liquor,
But a basketwork range?
It's alarming; it's strange.
If she won't change her mind, I might kick her.

A beggar of fame and renown
Plied the byways of old London town.
Toss a tuppence his way,
He would hound you each day
Till he'd touched you for more than a crown.

If it ends in a  ?, one surmises
That in reading the piece, the voice rises,
So we know it's a query
(At least that's the theory).
Our language is full of surprises!

List activity stages to do;
List the time that each task will accrue;
Overcome lazy tendencies:
Note all dependencies—
Tasks, in their places, you view.

My neurologist firmly asserts
That my alpha wave cues no alerts.
I'm awake and at rest,
And this EEG test
Reads from 8 up to 13 calm hertz.

In lands where the chicle trees grew,
Sticky gum could be tapped, Aztecs knew.
Though still sweet and elastic,
Our chewing gum's plastic—
Ponder that, the next gumstick you chew.

A Luddite proclaimed in frustration,
"SUVs are the scourge of the nation!
Abominations! I yearn
So to burn, each in turn,
All the SUVs parked at the station."

I find limericks are always a flop.
Though with gusto they start at the top,
All my great expectation
Succumbs to frustration
Down here, when abruptly they stop.

Antibiotics will weaken
Or kill the bacteria seekin'
A host to infect,
To roast and deject.
So get to your doctor — stop freakin'!

Your proctologist called and he said
That they didn't find polyps. Instead,
As they rummaged around
Through the clutter they found
Miscellaneous crap—and your head.

It's a bit of a cheat, I confess,
To say B-T-D-T-G-T-S
Is a word! But I'm sure
That you've been there before
And done that, got the shirt too, I guess.

Use cellular concrete to build
The walls of your home, if you're skilled.
That avoids, at low cost,
Wasted heat that gets lost—
And you'll never feel painfully chilled.

While the others conjectured or guessed,
All the salient points you addressed;
Hit the nail on the head,
Left no doubt—not a shred—
Scored bang on with your plan. I'm impressed.

"First the bar near my office," says Dwight,
"Then my local is where I'll alight."
Diarticular tension
He calls this convention:
He's tight in two joints every night.

Jack got bopped on the head (with a crozier!)
By the bishop, who'd lost his composure
When he called Jack a brat
And Jack cracked, "Man, you're fat!"
Now Jack prays for a speedy wound closure.

Entomophilous plants require bugs—
Certain insects, not wind, birds or slugs:
Perhaps beetles or bees
Spread their seed, not the breeze.
Guess these critters deserve herbal hugs.

He assured them he'd guarantee growth
Or make good any loss to them both,
But the stock market crashed
After which, unabashed,
He reneged and went back on his oath.

A cornett? Spelling error, you think.
But it's not, I reply with a wink,
For unlike a cornet,
This one's wood, you can bet.
If in Germany, ask for a Zink.

He said, "Hey! Come and dine at my house,
Though the meal is bare-bones."  But his spouse
Really gives me a scare;
Would she really serve bear?
I would rather eat pheasant or grouse.

While travelling in England, Jane tried a
Large glass of a local-made cider.
She became discontented —
The drink was fermented —
And alcohol vented outside her.

Tides of winnowing vapours stretch tight
Scudding wisps between frail shadow's light.
Silent clamourings glow
Through Arcadian snow,
Give my pale abstract thoughts second sight.

When a don tells his wiseguys to kill,
He knows that they probably will
Do away with the thug
With a shiv or a slug.
Such procedures are run-of-the-mill.

When the genny went bad on my car,
Lights were flashing. I didn't get far.
A car will devour
Electrical power.
No charge means no go; no cigar.

He's the cat who would never demur
When the baby would pull on his fur;
He'd alight in her lap,
Settle down for a nap,
Close his eyes and contentedly purr.

The Flemings (they're Belgians) speak Dutch,
Which is spoken in Flanders as such
(Like in Antwerp or Ghent,
Where they may pay their rent,
And where French isn't spoken that much).

My new co-star is sure to beguile:
Natural equipoise, balance and style—
Debonair, even cool,
Till that edge made me drool.
He'll stop hearts with that devilish smile.

Stout Lord Cardigan led the wild thrust
To attack Balaclava or bust.
But a great price was paid
By that brave Light Brigade,
With too many mowed down in the dust.

This activity's much to my liking,
And it's easily better than hiking.
I'm employing my feet
Yet enjoying a seat
As I glide down the street—I am biking.

I used to have money—a barrelful.
Things changed; now my world seems more peril-ful.
And what's worse, I've got kids;
Since I'm now on the skids,
I've been wishing that I'd been more sterile-ful.

Early reading books; alphabet chart;
Pencils, paper, and paint-pots for art;
Tiny chairs, there's one each,
Plus a teacher to teach:
It's the classroom where schooling will start.

The mild, tasty, white farmer's cheese,
Made from curds of skim milk (if you please),
Will be usually soured.
At our house it's devoured,
Though an allergy makes us all wheeze.

Our sports club would like to confer
This award, and our members concur
That whoever's the winner
Must appear at our dinner—
That's why all famous players demur.

This detainment is lawful, amigo.
You must show them you're legal, Rodrigo.
Your complexion makes clear
You weren't born around here.
Step aside. I'm a white guy, let me go.

Emboldened, its greed never ceased;
So, this ogre continued to feast
On the small and the weak.
Will the donkeys soon streak
To a win? ("Grand Old PAChyderm" beast!)

Now and then, as I lie in my bed,
Half awake, I sense deep in my head
Raucous noises and light,
With a feeling of fright;
That exploding head syndrome I dread.

Hear Fred Flintstone in Daba? Go to
Southern Chad (they speak Daba); then you
Must engage in a search
For an abba in church,
And say, "Hey, abba, speak Daba—do!"

When you say my career is a sham,
It's that Auto-Tune software you slam.
For this fame, I've no choice
But to upgrade my voice,
'Cause I really can't sing worth a damn.

Our town's been bedecked by the snow,
And I love the white wintry tableau.
But enough is enough —
There's too much of this stuff!
I'll be first, when spring comes, to hello.

The cattle were tested, then scoured
In strong disinfectant and showered
With antibiotics
To calm one neurotic's
Concerns. (He's their tender, the cowherd.)

Two structures are both called Eustachian—
One, in mammals and creatures batrachian,
Is a tube in their ears,
While the other appears
In our hearts since, at least, times Noachian.

The lizard that's called callisaurus,
In the desert would never ignore us.
He would flee and he might
Show his tail, black and white.
He'd amuse and delight—never bore us.

My husband would give me no peace
Till I bought him a pint of cassis,
But I knew what would follow:
Consumed in one swallow!
Then he grinned and flew south with the geese.

If a Mycobacterium bo-
vis infection hits cows, they may show
Signs of bovine TB.
Buy a cure (it's not free)
Or just cull, cut your losses, save dough.

A best looker was Bess, yes, she was
With her shiny black fur, and because
She was slim, but not thin,
A black panther's small kin,
And had beautiful little white paws.

Though her dealing was sloppy and artless,
This chicane would undoubtedly smart less
If some other chump
Had declared hearts as trump.
Hell, my hand and my ex are both heartless!

The rest of our rhyme clearly shows,
In the garden, the Maid hanging clothes,
When a blackbird (now free)
From his perch in a tree
Swiftly swept in and pecked off her nose.

Many countries in Europe today
Keep the hours of their clocks set one way.
In the winter, you see,
They all use CET;
When it's warm, CEST holds sway.

Cytologic, this smear over here
Shows a red cell that looks like a sphere,
And the white cells look queer.
It's a new disease, dear;
I'll describe it and boost my career.

Noisy neighbors upstairs play CDs
On their boombox. Lord, stifle it, please!
Compact discs pound my head
With the music I dread.
My poor eardrums are pierced like Swiss cheese.

"Your apology's rather belated,"
Said the gal to a fellow she hated.
"Your delay makes me fear
That it isn't sincere—
You still had your hair when we dated!"

We're flying at speeds supersonic
By means of machines avionic.
If they go on the fritz,
It spells trouble: our mitts
Aren't that fast without aid electronic.

"Lads, 'tis risky to sail this old ship!
She's a camberkeeled jinx!" warned our skip.
"If the ship hogged and broke,
We'd be in for a soak.
Down to Davy Jones' locker we'd slip."

"Dysaesthesia aethiopica!" raves
Doctor Cartwright. "What's wrong with your slaves?
This mental disease
Makes them not want to please.
It's no wonder a slave misbehaves."

Our Arabian camel (one hump),
Seeing poor punctuation, will grump.
Our proofreading dromedary,
If we've not commaed re-
sponsibly, spits like a pump.

From the scaffolding ledge Bobby slipped,
But with harness and wire was equipped.
Dangling high in midair,
He kept cool, didn't swear;
"Look at that — he's Aplomb Bob!" we quipped.

I've got several ageable aunts
Absolutely addicted to dance.
Though all long in the tooth,
They seem graceful with youth
In Terpsichore's magical trance.

My donk has a face sorta goaty.
His gait is more bumpy than floaty.
He attempts every day
To get grain stedda hay,
And that's why he's called Donkey Oaty.

A catechist opens a mission,
But generates fear and suspicion.
His lessons on Christ,
Which might once have sufficed,
Are rebuffed by Islamic tradition.

Evolution: I've got it down pat.
It created both us and the rat.
It doesn't take sides;
If it works, it abides.
It's the ultimate pragmatist, that!

Far from home, on a holiday cruise,
And emboldened by distance and booze,
I had Gigi with Kat,
Then androgynous Pat,
And I won't have to hear my reviews.

Something crazy goes on when this weed
Is mixed up in an animal's feed.
Cows may eat just un poco
And still become loco,
Vaqueros and cowboys concede.

No, you cannot play hooky from school.
No, you cannot break every last rule.
Well, you can, as you know,
But please don't, 'cause it's so
Sophomoric to act like a fool.

Vinicultural vying took shape.
Welch's workers were watching, agape.
There, at last, was a truce
Between "jelly" and "juice"—
They had found a concordable grape.

The appropriateness was in question:
The audience booed the suggestion
That the Lion King's roar
Was a burp, nothing more,
Since he suffered from bad indigestion.

To a shop in the mall I am heading
For the dress that I'll wear to my wedding.
It's a beaut, white as milk,
Made of angel skin silk,
Waistline pinched, with the skirt gently spreading.

The jailed gunslinger Billy the Kid
Said he'd robbed Sheriff West and then hid.
He relayed, with a sigh,
The bold sheriff's goodbye:
"Catch you later," he'd said. (And he did!)

Other horses were clearly outclassed
As they turned and came thundering past.
Kelso surged to the lead,
And kept laying on speed,
Legs galloping blurringly fast.

"Well, now that's a coincidence!" came
Her response upon learning the same
Spiny shrub that was worn
As a crown to adorn
Jesus Christ is a thorn with His name.

In Colossians, St. Paul the Apostle
Said that God is supreme and colossal.
Those with different beliefs
Caused a bunching of briefs
For the bald, apostolic old fossil.

Had my buildings been built on a stilt
Far above the alluvial silt
On those plots that I've gotten,
They'd stop going rotten,
Like most other buildings I've built.

'Cause of harsh puritanical views
Via blue laws, we're down with the blues.
I strongly object
To a Sabbath respect
That enforces a ban on all booze.

You started your life as a cell,
As an ovum (an egg with no shell),
But a sperm came along
With a smile and a song—
Now you're paying your taxes—ah, well!

That empiric (unqualified hack
With no obvious curative knack)
On the hospital's roster
Is just an imposter
Whose license needs lifting, that quack.

"It's short, as such science terms go,
But it's show-offy. Use words we know.
Why not just call it thread?"
"We say filum instead,
Because bug butt bits aren't used to sew."

A man falls in love with a crab.
"You're so fabulous, Abby!" he'll blab,
But his gab can't convince 'er;
He'll grab for her pincer.
She'll wince and cry, "Call me a cab!"

"You're aliterate—never liked reading;
All your brain-furrows badly need seeding.
Your books are all shut...."
"I'm a literate what?"
(What remained of our chat involved bleeding.)

The galop from Orphée aux enfers
Sets the cancan, a dance with French flair,
For a line of loose flirts,
Kicking high in loose skirts,
Wearing nothing but powder down there.

Altitudinarians often have flights
Of fancy: their names up in lights.
They're the types who aspire
To climb ever higher.
Their goals are the highest of heights.

Bought a lottery ticket with Fred.
"If we win, we'll go halfies," he said.
Now he hands me this pottery,
Says, "Here's your allottery."
So I whomps him upside of the head.

You need to be bailed out? You oughter
Not sail if your boat takes on water.
I've got a tin can,
But if I was you, Dan,
I would just take her back where I'd bought her.

When great tennis star Margaret Court
Won her first Aussie title, the sport
Chose to give her a brolly.
Though she might have cried "Golly!",
Will it rain on my reign? was her thought.

In this drawing I made of our sister,
The ink and its color are bistre,
Transparent and brown
From her eyes to her gown,
With a stain where the artisan kissed her.

In Montana, folks don't cry "Hosanna!"
At the sight of this fruit: dwarf banana.
They're not found there at all.
Grown in China, they're small,
But to those who enjoy them, they're manna.

As we reach the extent of our age,
Should we burn? Not go gentle, but rage?
Or should we instead
Take this chapter as read
And turn over the welcoming page?

In the lounge, the convention begins:
Slapping backs, swapping handshakes and grins.
Seeking Babbitts? You got 'em.
The conventioneer: spot him?
There, festooned with his badges and pins.

The one missing from Grace, out of place?
The drunk sot with the beery-eyed face.
He is now not allowed
To hang out on our cloud.
It's the third time he's fallen from grace.

Growing older and older, I yearn
To hold on to the facts that I learn.
All the terms I forget,
Names and places, are yet
Just abeyant, until they return.

We were landlocked and dry as could be.
We decided to issue this plea:
"You're our last, best resort;
We need use of your port
And a corridor through to the sea."

Private Johnson was killed in the war,
Yet his pay still arrives as before.
This is dead-pay, a crime—
Someone ought to do time!
Such corruption we ought to deplore.

If you want a great deal on some teal,
There's a deal to be had back in Deal.
If you deal with this trade,
A steal can be made,
If you deal the cards right — spin the wheel.

It is hard to write verse on the pelican
With no belican rhyme, likewise helican.
"Who can make me," you cry,
"A nice sea bird on rye?"
I'd say maybe some strange Saint Kitts delican.

Cruciverbalists learn crosswordese,
Filling puzzles with words such as these:
Dies irae and busto —
Less-used words that you must know
To solve crossword puzzles with ease.

This chain store's a 24/7
Convenience for people—it's heaven!
Buy magazines, candy,
Or Pampers—it's handy
To shop at a 7-Eleven.

As a tot, I tooled 'round  on a trike;
Now grown-up, I can zoom on my bike.
Through stalled traffic I zip
At a quick speedy clip—
Need no gas and I don't have to hike.

Diltiazem, AKA Dilzem—
Folk bring me prescriptions, I fills 'em.
If they ain't polite
Well, then sometimes I might
Give 'em strychnine instead, which just kills 'em.

Stress OEDILF as this dictionary's name
(Please, no OEDILF: that's just not the same);
Though it's counterintuitive,
Here we must do it if
Ever we hope for acclaim.

At an arms trade I pulled off today,
I sent shiploads of guns on their way.
I got plenty of gold
For the weapons I sold;
I'd sell bombs to small kids if they'd pay.

"That man is ahorse," said Ms. Marr.
"No way!" I replied. "That's bizarre.
That rider, of course,
Is a man. That's the horse.
Next you'll tell me that door is a jar."

Once you've written our pamphlet, please keep
All the printing costs low. Up they'll creep
With a high-priced designer.
The cost will be minor
With clip art; it's simple and cheap!

Moulinette, passatutto, passe-vite —
Some puréers of veggies and meat.
A food mill's the main
Way to sieve and to strain
Stuff that young and old toothless folks eat.

This great soda, a sugary drink,
Is far sweeter than most folks would think—
It's not healthy for you!
But I love it, it's true—
Dr Pepper puts me in the pink!

When our team lost the game 14–3,
It was obvious soon there would be
A brouhaha brewing.
We all started booing,
Abusing the poor referee.

An asthmatic partook of a waffle in
A diner, which made her sound awful in
Just seconds!  Her wheezing
Showed no signs of easing:
She'd forgotten to take aminophylline.

All that's living will have to, some day,
Face a fate of demise and decay.
Nature tells us we must
Decompose—"dust to dust."
Nonplused? We recycle that way.

Have you noticed how folks in their prime
Will believe growing old is a crime?
But although they are waging
A war against aging,
In the end, they'll surrender to time.

I speak properly; so did my fah-ther.
I'll use slang if I must, but I'd rah-ther
My language reflect
My profound self-respect.
When I do interject, I say, "Bother!"

"Don't recite Grampa's failings," she said.
"Give a eulogy (goodwords) instead.
At a funeral, who
Wants the truth, Willie? You
Should speak well of him." "Sure. Grampa's dead."

When a move by a foe causes stress,
Like exposing your sins in the press,
The countermove's clear:
You should just disappear—
Change your phone number, name, and address.

An omnificent volume that's prime—
The OEDILF, and we put in our time
Using anapest style,
Which might cause you to smile,
While held spellbound by meaningful rhyme.

A Barbie doll, thin as a rake,
Doesn't look like she ever eats cake.
A connection, subliminal,
To the Nazi war criminal
Klaus Barbie would be a mistake.

Using cable ties locks wires in place,
Keeping snake pits of cords neat in space.
They are made of hard plastic,
Or of Velcro, elastic.
Now your cubicle's not a disgrace.

I'm a coach horn; at first I was straight—
Too awkward. But coiled I was great.
Now, in musical works
I get too many  smirks.
Without valves I've a limited fate.

I have hundreds of "platters" to spin,
And a contest each day you can win.
I'm a disc jockey who
Is told just what to do:
Play the same songs again and again.

Hallucinogenics? Don't sniff any.
Few are good for your well-being, if any.
There's no life revelations,
Deep realizations
From substance abuse — no epiphany.

I recounted the tale of my woe,
Of the dough that I lost, and the blow
To my honor, and how
I prevailed, and feel now.
All I got was a "Cool story, bro."

Throughout the UK you can bet
On the horses or football — just get
To the betting shop, where
You can dream if you dare,
But night mares may mount up your debt.

Bye bye, elephant birds in the sky.
You don't see one? Extinction is why.
Aepyorniformes' vast
Feathered wings did not last,
So below  with relief we all sigh.

My dinner was pea soup with ham,
Caesar salad, a roast leg of lamb,
Pie, and cake (two desserts);
Now my abdomen hurts.
Mother says, "You're a pig." Yes, I am.

There are zealots who scoff and decree
That the son of God Christ couldn't be.
I've a Christian name,
Wed in church, kids the same.
Hence my faith (love to all): C of E.

Blood corpuscles, white ones and red,
Are the cells in the blood that you've shed.
If you don't stop that bleeding,
Your limit exceeding,
You'll end up a corpse, and be dead!

"Pickled Flower Buds Gone!"  I will tape her
Account of the theft for my paper.
This Canaveral Mrs.
Cries, "What a crime this is!"
We'll name it "The Cape Caper Caper."

John Audubon, chronicled birder,
Authored bird books, an honored bird-worder.
Myriad species he painted;
His technique, though, seems tainted,
His specimens gleaned by bird-murder.

Should a devil approach, the good monk'll
Bring forth the Good Book. Averruncal,
It turns demons away
(It helps if you pray)
Before you can say "Bob's your uncle!"

Accostable? That's my friend Jack,
He'll chat and then welcome you back.
For some help or a natter,
Especially the latter,
Choose him, as he does have the knack.

The snowfall last evening was nifty,
And we still like to ski, though we're fifty.
Still, I doubt we'll be seeing
Much cross-country skiing;
The snow is too wind-blown and drifty.

The word earthshock is one you can use
To mean "earthquake." To me, this is news.
Into Scrabble? I'd say
It's a great word to play
When your rack is devoid of all Q's.

"Bare thy blade and avert not thine eye;
There's a dragon, a firedrake nearby:
A huge, fierce flying snake
Whose hot breath would thee bake."
Wizard warnings one daren't defy.

A cover point aims to despatch
Hapless batsmen, and so end their match.
As he tries for one run,
The batsman's undone
By a sprint, then a leap, and a catch.

For a codpiece my crotch fairly begs
(Mother Nature left me with the dregs!);
But I'll never be found
In the town running round
With a cold wad of cod 'twixt my legs!

I essayed to read Finnegans Wake.
That was clearly a ghastly mistake;
For when one has a choice
One does not read James Joyce—
His Englanguage be nopeace a cake.

When a dotted note sits on the staff,
Its new value's itself, plus one half.
You played two beats, but, see,
With the dot, it's worth three—
Get it wrong, and we'll all have a laugh.

"Darling dear, shall we go out to dine?
I'm engaging a table at nine.
I'll reserve it till ten,
So we have until then
To eat up, pay and leave, sweetheart mine."

My son-in-law Wayne is insane
About fashion; he's terribly vain.
All his tailor-made suits
(And they really are beauts)
Are of worsted—the finest delaine.

Choose a cudgel as weapon? You're thick
As this short, rather cumbersome stick!
My advice: fire a gun
From a distance—then run.
Don't look back.  Stay alive. That's the trick.

The pipes are so slow to my sink
That they must be cloomed up. So I think,
"What is causing this clog?
Could it be a dead frog,
Or some hair or some grease or a skink?"

A coder was losing his wits:
"This program is giving me fits!
It'll take me a while,
But I must decompile
To make sense out of all of these bits."

What you said was bad form, I should mention:
An offense against social convention.
With your tongue-in-cheek toast,
You insulted your host  —
I do hope that was not your intention!

Once renowned for my book Crime Scene Hints,
I got sloppy, then canned. Ever since,
I've been washing the car
Of that "Formerly..." star,
Then I clean and go dusting for Prince.

As the gold miners exit the lift
To a level path known as a drift,
Which runs right by the vein
Of the ore, they refrain
From pocketing gold as a gift.

After one of my teacher's harangues
I'm a jelly of paralyzed pangs.
Though I'm feeling quite scrod,
There's a merciful God:
She's aglyphous (lacks venomous fangs).

Does cross-country not challenge enough?
Step it up, man; don't leave in a huff.
Take a fell running flyer —
All the climbs you require.
I'm retired — I'll sit on my duff.

Oh, the shame! Oh, the pain! Oh, the swine
Who imbibed our most precious ice wine!
Bigly-flavored and bold
And exceedingly old —
It was vintage of ninety and nine.

Rory really has pulled out a plum,
Such a true comeback kid! It was dumb
When he first blew the Masters
With driving disasters,
But he then won the Open—no bum!

My friend is distressed by dyspnoea.
He struggles for breath, and it's clear
His problem dyspnoic
Needs effort heroic —
He's marathon running next year!

Daddy's dead. A discretionary trust,
He devised "so fool girl won't go bust".
Uncle Ted, my trustee,
Not a jot cares for me.
I must beg for each crust. That's unjust!

Disorder is rampant and rife,
And the world is chaotic with strife.
You may think you are set
But there's always the threat
That time's arrow will cut like a knife.

"I will daylight my room," declared Fred, 
"With a skylight built over my bed." 
"That will cost quite a lot. 
It is cash you've not got, 
And you'll still need a nightlight," Dad said.
 
When he saw that his dad was dismayed,
Fred replied, "You need not be afraid.
The motel needs a clerk.
Every evening I'll work—
Dad, I'll moonlight until the debt's paid!"

My new aerie's delightful, it's true,
With its dawn-greeting easterly view.
As a day gathers steam,
I look out at a dream:
Golden sunbeams and glistening dew.

God's elect should be pretty darn sure
That their souls are untainted and pure,
That their predestination
Means certain salvation.
Who's elect? God's released no brochure.

Let that chymotrypsinogen lurk
In your gut, pancreatical perk!
It's an enzyme that's split
By the trypsin there. It
Then turns proteins to acids. Good work!

In our alcohol-powered society,
It is clear that we have a variety
Of nouns we can use
For "the fallout of booze,"
And the oddest of these is ebriety.

If you publish a book in Azeri,
You will find that the alphabets vary:
Whereas Azerbaijan
Has Cyrillic, Iran
Uses Arabic. Printers, be wary!

Had a spat with your sweetie? A buss
On the cheek might not end all the fuss.
Kiss her well—in your arms—
She'll succumb to your charms
And there'll be nothing more to discuss.

The phrase ashes to ashes you might
Think is found in the Bible.  Not quite,
Though in essence it's there.
It is part of a prayer,
Paired with dust, in a burial rite.

If they name you as chairman, beware
Should this mean that you're one of a pair.
We've a boss, "Half-Ton Harry,"
The two of us carry
'Round town in his damn sedan chair.

I'm on Boardwalk and ready to throw
But old Vlad, my opponent's, so slow.
It's such a short dash
To collect needed cash,
But I'm sitting, awaiting Go dough.

Alcaeus, Greek writer of yore,
Wrote poetry once, but no more.
His meter obtuse
Gives me ample excuse
To find verse that's alcaic a bore.

It appears something's wrong with my chow;
I've been farting and burping, and how!
And the worst of my troubles?
I'm drooling small bubbles —
My face is all foamy right now.

From Anjou "Captain Margaret" is beckoned
And soon by opponents is reckoned
"The she-wolf of France"
As she dons the king's pants
In Henry the Sixth, Part the Second.

Counterirritants help to divert
Your attention, but may disconcert
By inflaming the skin.
You'll forget your chagrin
When you find that they lessen your hurt.

The costume with baubles was packed;
With gems it was fronted and backed.
It had spangles galore,
Yet they added one more:
An accessory after the fact.

Friar Tuck is a name you will ken:
An old outlaw, in forest and glen.
Remember the friar
In monk-like attire?
The most godly of Robin Hood's men.

"My support for this bill I profess."
Is he voting his conscience?  I guess,
But the timing seems strange
For his compass to change —
What was wrong now is right; he'll vote yes.

A frog in the lily pond blinked,
Then he blew out his cheeks and he winked,
"Gotta kiss for a prince?"
First I gave him a rinse
'Cos the smell of the bog was distinct.

The bottom's dropped out of the market,
And I'm bummed by what happened to spark it.
The butt lift I'd planned
In Dumbarton's been canned.
And my droddum? I'll just have to park it.

I could sue you. You know I have grounds:
I've been shadowed by two of your clowns.
Stop your posturing, bro,
And I'll get you your dough.
I'll pay you. Just call off your hounds.

Oh my god, it's my birthday—again!
Though I used to be young (way back when),
Too much age I have gained,
And today I've attained
My biblical three score and ten.

These productions are not realistic.
They're Eurotrash: sexy, sadistic,
And geopolitical.
They're all hypocritical,
With a dash of the pseudo-artistic.

When you're bushed, you are lost or perplexed
Or exhausted (says OED's text),
But according to Vaux,
Bush'd means "penniless", so
Now you know. Let's go on to the next.

Callicebus medemi is black-handed;
An indirect kudo is backhanded.
When you muck a thing up—
Botch the job, drop your cup—
Many people will say you are cack-handed.

When Count Dracula smacked the ball fat,
All fans heard was a squeak and a SPLAT!
The Desmodus he chose
When he hit for the "Hose"
Was an unlucky vampire bat.

My friend Seth is aesthetic, poetic,
But so filled with ennui, he's pathetic,
While his animated cousin
Keeps everything buzzin'—
Energetic, athletic, kinetic!

Powdered dynamite, just a few grains,
Lifts folk high, but destructively drains;
Some inject, or inhale
For that heroin gale:
The explosive effect on the brains.

Batrachophobics are now on the road
To recovery, research has showed.
For you frog-fearing folk,
A full cure is no joke:
See your therapists—do as you're toad.

I'm too frail now for trips to Armenia—
Their mean neighbors induce neurasthenia.
I'll miss Ararat's sight
Every Yerevan night;
I'll make do with Armeniopenia.

When you duckwalk, you mimic ducks' ways;
On the catwalk a model sashays;
To jaywalk on roads
Is against highway codes;
And in sheepwalks there's pasture to graze.

Cinematically, Tom was restricted,
Since to prison films he was addicted.
When a riot ensues,
Who to cheer—cons or screws?
"Can't decide," Tom admitted, conflicted.

I was begging my lead-footed niece,
"This ridiculous speeding must cease!
As your passenger, I'm
Not that worried 'bout time.
Please just get me there all in one piece!"

As it grows, a plant's stem must get thick;
For an exogen, outside's the pick
Of the place for new growths,
While an endogen's troth's
Pledged to inside the plant's budding stick.

"You are earthbred," I tell him. "I know,"
He replies. "That is certainly so."
Do I mean that his birth
Had occurred here on Earth?
No, I'm calling him vulgar and low.

Devoutly, she worships at night,
In religious pursuit of  delight,
As a lover so lithesome,
Gone coupling, blithesome,
The consummate lighthearted spright.

After drinking a large cup of tea,
There's an urgent desire to pee.
Diuretic caffeine
Flushes bladders all clean.
And so off to the toilet you flee.

Kid, consider yourself oh-so lucky
That we found your beloved Rub-Me Ducky.
It was very fortuitous:
The search path circuitous,
From bath to Ye Pond Mucky-yucky.

What's erasure? The act of erasing,
With intent (in this case) of replacing,
Or a name for the space
Where the word I erase
Used to be (and the new one I'm tracing).

"The judge viewed your case with derision,
So he rendered an adverse decision.
But when paying my bill,
Do not bear me ill will,
'Cause I saved you from going to prison."

You can't get here by road or by rail,
And on foot it's a tortuous trail.
I have always been fond
Of the back of beyond:
Miles from anywhere o'er hill and dale.

They buried old Joe on the knoll,
And the chaplain said, "God rest his soul."
Then the warden chimed in,
"Let his freedom begin
As he's granted a back-gate parole."

"Elementary particle zoo,"
Said the sign in a wavelength of blue.
"Pet a  boson or quark
In our new lepton park.
The cafe offers fermion stew."

They'd been told, "Do not fret about jail.
If you're nabbed, I'll be there without fail."
But the boss broke his word,
That untrustworthy turd,
And decided to not go their bail.

Drag-and-drop is a trick in computing
For iconic reboot-free re-rooting,
Weightless, waitless transposing
Of whatever's imposing
On the now-here of cyber-commuting.

In the seas twixt Byzantium and Crete,
Athens ruled, through the ships of its fleet.
It was at Aegospotami
The Spartan fleet got 'em. I
Weep for their tragic defeat.

Disencrese is now written decrease.
If you still use the former, please cease.
Folks will update, I've heard,
This now-obsolete word
From your writing at two bucks apiece.

Of Henry the Eighth (six times wedded),
Tales are told, and of ladies he bedded.
Number two, Anne Boleyn,
Henry's heart did not win.
In Londontown she was beheaded.

Need an MRI scan of your knee?
Gadolinium helps the docs see:
It's an IV injection
That helps with detection
Of whatever amiss there might be.

Coats do not grow on trees, you'll concur,
And most certainly not those of fur.
Then again, as you know,
We already can grow
A fine tree called the fir, as it were.

Dialectics are used to arrange
The Hegelian process of change
Into stages—just three.
In the middle, we see
The antithesis—contrary, strange.

You're brutal and cruel? You're barbarian.
Conspicuous wealth? You vulgarian!
But study all night
Getting rudiments right?
Well done! You're an abecedarian!

With their music, The Doors would ascend;
Their LPs going gold was a trend.
But Jim Morrison, lead,
Was a wild man indeed.
Before long, he broke through to the end.

My handwriting's just a tad iffy—
This code can't be cracked in a jiffy.
At times it's so runic
You might tear your tunic
Deciphering my scrawl, it's so glyphy.

"What's a style I might like to restore? A
Type of headgear," said Cora to Nora.
"Every day men wore hats.
They looked sexy, and that's
Why my dad always wore a fedora."

Brother Juniper gained the esteem
Of the whole human race, it would seem.
This daily strip's fun
Was unique as the one
Seen worldwide with religion its theme.

She's in labor, my sweetheart, my love,
And the doctor is urging her, "Shove!"
At her crotch, Doctor Hatch
Is preparing to catch
My new kid in a first baseman's glove.

Many months now I've dreamed as I've slumbered
Of weeks going by unencumbered.
Since Gregorian sages
Put digits on pages,
My calendar's days appear numbered.

An airborne suspension of smoke
Or dust, that could cause you to choke:
It's a toxic black cloud;
Wraps the sun in a shroud —
Air pollution is far from a joke.

Antiperistasis is power
Increased by resistance. I cower.
Now defiance prevails,
But supposing it fails?
I'd be crushed and pressed flat, like a flower.

Clear-sightedly editing work
Of new writers means clearing the murk
From your vision of how
You'd revise it. For now,
Build rapport,  lest they think you're a jerk.

Said the chef to his cooks, "I'm the boss,
Shred that cheese! Better speed up the sauce!
Great dishes can't wait —
But you ingrates won't grate.
My flounder Mornay? Total loss!"

The police placed him under arrest.
At the scene of the crime he professed
Some close ties to the judge;
But the cops wouldn't budge.
His aligning was suspect at best.

Short-term history doesn't say squat,
'Cause the breadth of achievements cannot,
Without time, be known truly.
I'm chastised unduly.
My hunch — down the road?  Not a lot.

Laid my sister to rest (none was fairer);
Shoveled sod, asked the good Lord to spare her...
"Yo, dude, that was not
The right burial plot!"
Said my bro. Seems I made a grave error.

Dendrocolaptinae, insectivore bird,
Includes fifty-some species, I've heard.
A tree-climbing creature,
These woodcreepers feature
Long bills (not so long they're absurd!).

Queenie's barely inside her bikini.
Parts pop out as the thing is so teeny.
She is bountifully breasted
And could be arrested:
Indecent exposure by Queenie.

Give me elbow room, dammit! Don't crowd me.
I want all the free space that's allowed me.
When I'm dead, I won't care,
But right now? Give me air!
I'm alive! It's not time to enshroud me.

Is your lead-acid battery flat?
Washed your keyboard, and now you can't chat?
Did your steam iron fuse?
It's a sign you should use
Deionized water for that.

So the boss found a new fair-haired boy—
Her advisor/companion—her toy.
Soon she'll learn he's a rat,
And discard him… like that—
A comeuppance I itch to enjoy.

Dear Osama bin Laden, relax;
There's no need for more vicious attacks.
As head of Al-Qaeda
You took on The Decidah.
You're grody, and that's to the max.

We know that the devil can use
Holy scripture to further his views.
Yet, when we defend
Common sense to the end,
Neither devil nor saint do we choose.

An aecium's the spore-bearing fruit
(Somewhat chainlike or stalked on its shoot)
Of the fungus called rust.
And stand up it must,
For in truth it is rather minute.

Said the girl to the handsome young fluter,
"Your instrument couldn't be cuter.
Is it made, do you think,
Out of nickel, or zinc,
Or Britannia metal, or pewter?"

If your left channel leaks to the right,
And the right to the left, as it might,
Then your stereo sound
Won't be quite "in the round"
Because cross-talk has ruined it, quite.

My son, 3: "Dolly, send in the clone!"
Of Kate Moss: "Does she read Rolling Stone?"
His wordplay's precocious,
His puns are ferocious;
We're braced for the day he's full groan.

In Alaska, I bag kangaroo.
It's my bag — what I love most to do.
What's that? You've concluded
I'm stupid, deluded?
Well, next time I go, you come too!

First he's late for the date with his belle.
Adding insult to injury? Well,
He complains that the grill
She's selected serves swill,
So he will spend an evening in hell.

She'll come out at a dance in the fall,
And can't wait for the swains she'll enthrall.
But this teen doesn't know
That she's signed up to go
To the Lesbian Debutante Ball.

Be aware, if you cherish the notion
To swear loyalty, love and devotion
To a girl—she'll take flight
If her feelings are slight
And she doesn't return such emotion.

Said Noah to one of his buds:
"I sure hope that my plans aren't all duds!
I don't want to get caught —
I'm afraid that I've got
Antlophobia; I'm frightened of floods!"

An antileukemic-type drug
Can't kill off a virus or bug.
It's a treatment for cancer
Of blood cells—the answer
For kids who need more than a hug.

Although only one fossil's involved,
One honeybee question's resolved:
There were hairy-eyed bees
In Nevada's moist breeze
(Native Apis), before we evolved.

The proud axis, a South Asian deer,
Carries antlers as sharp as a spear.
Facing one, I am cowed,
Though — for crying out loud —
How could "axises" (sic!) cause me fear?

They took cattle cross-country and swept them
Through wide-open prairies, then kept them
Together at night
On a bed ground just right
When no Holiday Inn would accept them.

Said the singer of hair band Death's Door,
"When the bridge ends at bar 24,
Grab the bridge of your bass
And start trashing the place,
While I scream the refrain one time more."

With life's pressures and meds, for Pete's sake,
Proper treatments are no piece of cake.
Disarrayed and distraught,
You're a chaos of thought,
And that busy brain keeps you awake.

The alopex lives near the pole,
Where he feeds on the marmot and vole,
And wears socks on his feet
In his wintry retreat:
A cosy Alaskan fox-hole.

Four-leaf clovers, they say, are good luck.
I've found many, but never been struck
By a lottery win
Or bequest from my kin,
So when pigeons fly over, I duck!

"So you're out on the lake, in the barge,
With a corpse and a knife," says the sarge.
"Never meant him to die,"
Says the kid. "Honest, I
Can explain, if you'll let me enlarge."

Every happy event turns adverse,
Like your life has come under a curse.
When it ends catastrophically,
You shrug philosophically,
"So, nu? It could always be worse."

When Popeye was feeling a lack, he
Inspected each pocket and pack. He
Exclaimed, "It's no joke,
I'm in need of a smoke,
But Bluto has stolen me baccy!"

C. (genius genus), you thrill us—
The gnawing raw thought that you'll kill us;
That crocodile smile;
So much death on the Nile...
Oh the fangs, ah the pangs, Crocodylus.

My move should have caused him chagrin;
Yet my rival said "Draw!" with a grin.
Well, let's pause and take stock:
I've created a block,
But this game is checkers—I win!

My car's gilded (that's covered with gold).
It looks classy, or so I am told.
Though the coating's quite thin, it
Has only gold in it.
I'll be paying it off till I'm old.

The blindsided lawyer yelled "Twit!
There's no trusting you, not the least bit.
Why, you seem not to care
If I'm caught unaware —
One more thing, and I swear, I will quit!"

The corrugator, under the skin
Of your forehead, is limp when you grin,
But just scowl and see how
It contracts neath your brow,
And this muscle makes wrinkles begin.

An "eel blenny" ain't blenny or eel.
He's a dottyback — that name's for real.
Do not pet!  Be judicious:
Some species are vicious.
Your finger might be his next meal.

Rash do-somethingism's his creed.
He reflexively thinks that we need
To take action right now.
He would even allow
The depriving of rights guaranteed.

In the house where the tenant had roomed
Is the arsenate he had consumed.
Since the tenant had reasoned
His food had been seasoned
With salt, now the tenant is doomed.

I'm struggling to sort through this stack,
Keeping track of the paint on this rack.
Up I clumsily clamber
Past umber and amber
To track down the black in the back.

Cousin Alice feels safe and serene
When she's hooked to this wondrous machine
Undergoing dialysis.
Here's her analysis:
"Treatment will keep my blood clean."

Dear Aretha, I find I'm compelled
To remark that the word you have spelled,
Being L-O-N-G,
Hurts my H-E-A-D.
Disrespectfully yours, [name withheld].

The lacquer applied to the knob
Quickly dried without leaving a blob,
So allow me to gush on
The use of a brush-on
For those in a rush on the job.

You're a down-to-earth woman, it's true,
And I gravitate toward you, I do.
My attraction's on full.
Like in gravity's pull,
I am hopelessly falling for you.

Seems his flock is attempting to block
The new bishop's intent to defrock
Father Rocco—who made
Some mistakes, but has paid
For his sins. It's a terrible shock!

A practical tailor named Roth
Goes for wool, but is scared of the moth;
So he sews a thick coat
To be worn on his boat,
Made of chamlet, a waterproof cloth.

A baby wagon (also called pram)
Is a carriage for baby boy Sam.
We bought such a carriage
Before our June marriage
And carted it home on the tram.

In most situations it's right
That botrytis is but a bad blight.
But when grapes are for wine,
Noble rot is divine.
"Late harvest" is quite a delight.

My style's spartan: my books and my cat,
Unlike Fothergill's flossy new flat.
Where I'm warm second-hand,
He's importantly grand,
But as tasteless as mousse made non-fat.

At Gallipoli Turks made their stand.
Though the Brits and the French duly planned,
Their campaign was for naught
As the Ottomans fought
To repel both at sea and on land.

When I played for the tough NFL,
My poor head was oft rung like a bell.
It's apparent to me
I've the dread CTE —
My brain and my life's gone to hell.

In Helsinki they don't seem to care
That the planes are in need of repair.
On the typical night,
You'll see more than one flight
Disappearing right into Finnair.

Athaliah searched high and searched low
For her grandchildren. Why? To bestow
An affectionate hug?
No, to sever their jug-
ulars. Why? She was Queen. Now you know.

Shout hooray for Prince Clyde'sh coronation!
A firsht-rate enthron(hic)ization.
He offed his dad's head,
Sho now he's king inshtead;
I shay Clyde deserves one more libation!

For the latest in medieval wear,
Try a short sword that's curved — there's one there.
If swords are your passion,
That falchion's in fashion —
The choice of combatants who care.

Pedantic grammarian Fred
(A grammaticaster) recently said,
"I know bed is a noun,
But I'll certainly frown
If you bed Ted the med in our bed."

The colicroot, kin of the lily,
May help after eating hot chili,
Relieving your colic.
Its name is symbolic—
To me it just sounds rather silly.

Our teacher will issue  a prize
For doubling the cube's (volume) size
With just compass and rule—
She must think I'm a fool,
Cause they won't do the job, I surmise.

Our ambassador Voyagers race
To new places beyond Sol's embrace,
Heading into the zone
That is commonly known
By us Earthlings back home as deep space.

An Anglican chum of my mum's
Is so clumsy, we say when he comes:
"It's the maladroit minister,
Trés ambisinister.
Left hand or right, he's all thumbs."

He felt crushed—at the end of his rope.
Down life's avenues saw little scope.
So he knelt, offered prayer.
God was listening there—
Helped him get on his feet, blessed with hope.

The equestrians came out in force
When the Pony Express laid its course.
No criers were needed
With riders ensteeded;
Down the trail came the mailmen ahorse.

There are schemes for which plotters have need
Of a decoy, whose role is to lead
Into danger a victim,
Who won't know they've picked him
Or her — till their tactics succeed.

Some units of measures may get
Their own names when derived from a set
Of the base ones defined
In all countries which signed
The Convention's accepted septet.

An angler was spinning one day,
For a while on a stream 'round our way,
But he soon found a fly
Was indeed worth a try—
And then trout was for dinner, I'd say.

Lord Byron was dashing, with dough,
And Caroline Lamb loved him, though
He had girls in profusion.
She wrote, in seclusion:
"He's mad, bad and dangerous to know."

Although flak jacket wearing's a perk,
It would draw flak from jerks here at work.
Keep one near, standing by,
In case lead starts to fly.
Meanwhile, chill—you're the property clerk.

Here's perplexity: gather around,
For within, Leonard Cohen is found.
He's an angst-ridden poet
(Read his works, and you'll know it)
Who's adored by the rich and renowned.

Some call me a pack-rat, I fear,
But I'm a collector, it's clear.
It's all carefully sorted,
Preserved, and supported —
You see, I'm just archiving here!

My young daughter's as cute as can be.
But should I steal Ms. Dolly, then she
Becomes beast, just like that,
A fierce animalized brat,
Who will brutally set upon me.

The atomic electron appears
In the music a physicist hears:
The harmonics of strings
Forming orbital rings
In a Kepler-like music of spheres.

Cynicalness? Sid's is quite plain.
He looks down on the world with disdain.
His contemptuous sneer
Makes us cross, as it's clear
His complaints are completely inane.

Our soldier has now become justice,
As clever and rich as Augustus.
Rack of lamb with mint jelly
Fills his burgeoning belly;
Of all ages, this one's the robustest!

If you've lost lots of blood, as a rule
(So they taught me in medical school),
For immediate gain,
To send blood to your brain,
You'll reduce your abdominal pool.

Eight matches ignite eight discrete
Conflagrations.  Just wait — once they meet,
See my blazing creation:
A full deflagration,
With showers of sparks and great heat.

Chez Gordon, beware of the dangers:
He's rude to both colleagues and strangers.
Renowned for his cheffing,
His effing and jeffing,
And giein' it laldie with Rangers.

I had menstrual problems a lot.
I was early, then late. I got hot.
But the fragrant dong quai
Was prescribed, and thereby,
All my periods come on the dot.

Condensation of moisture from air
Can be seen as small droplets where there
Are cool faces below
What as "dew point" we know;
A component and heat transfer pair.

Here's a hound with incredible moxie:
The wiener dog, dachshund or dachsie.
Send him into a sett
For a badger? No sweat.
He will stick to the beast like epoxy.

In the abbey, our rations' commensurateness
Is ensured by a careful dispensurateness.
To the scruple, no brother
Gets more than another.
When sharing, it's plain commonsensurateness.

Misrepresentation in wooing
Has proved my unlikely undoing:
"I've been given the snip."
She went straight for my zip,
And the consequence now is ensuing.

"Give us glasnost!" the dissidents say.
"Let us see what's been hidden away!"
It's transparency's friend;
This aberrancy trend
Is a break from the Bolshoi ballet.

If cleverly used and applied,
The sciences—scientists' pride—
Give the engineers tools
And designers the rules
For the hi-tech toys selling worldwide.

At Lords, the ball raced down the slope
To the boundary; a four was the hope.
That was all we would need
For the team to succeed,
So we cheered as the ball crossed the rope.

Took my son to a theme park (Jurassic).
He said, "Dad this is great, it's so classic!"
But the rides cost a mint
So I ended up skint,
Or, as cockneys would say, quite boracic!

The guitar-slinging singing sensation,
Whose poster achieved veneration
Enshrined by her bed
(For three weeks, it is said),
Was demoted by delaceration.

It's a trial of our love and emotion
That attests to our faithful devotion:
I've been waiting all year
In my flat, over here,
While my bonnie lies over the ocean.

This language of markup's extensible.
Though in theory it seems to be sensible,
With each slash, every bracket,
Each feature to track — it
Can often be incomprehensible.

Gnathion: base of a jaw
(That thing that we all use to gnaw).
Its "G" is not sounded,
Which leaves some dumbfounded
Though gnaw is itself pronounced "naw".

When you served vegetarian turkey,
Our aliment quickly turned quirky.
How much time should it take
For your oven to bake
Sixteen pounds of a free-range tofurkey?

The study of fungi has grown
Through the ages; thus experts have shown
Growth of medical uses
And social abuses.
As ethnomycology it's known.

It's quite a rare bird is the chough.
Worms and beetles it eats, and that's tough.
Has a red beak and legs,
And will lay all its eggs
On a cliff. (Now you know quite  enough.)

It's not easy to live as a god;
People curse me and tell me I'm odd.
Though I'm packed with aseity,
I'm called a false deity.
Oh, flesh—such a joyless façade!

"What's an ethyl group?" asked Betty Boop.
"A boop-a-doop  girls' flapper troupe,
Singing radical jive?"
"No, it's C2H5,
Found in molecules. That's the straight poop."

I keep cinnabar moths out in back.
Callimorpha are large, red, and black.
They lay eggs in large batches,
And when the brood hatches,
On leaves of the ragwort they snack.

Curse that Hurricane Ivan and rain!
I've got flooding and no place to drain.
Now my door has absorpt
So much water, it's warped,
And the window is stuck—what a pane!

So you're saying invest in this stock?
What's the downside? What risk of a shock?
Is it likely to fall?
Could I lose my small all?
I'm in doubt, but that beats "I'm in hock."

It was love at first sight. She was swell:
Charming, graceful, and gorgeous as well.
Like an angel…  I froze.
She was picking her nose.
Well, that last, I admit, broke the spell.

Pope Adrian I held his seat
For a time not as long as Saint Pete:
Almost two dozen years
In a row. It appears,
For his time, that was truly a feat.

My living is made by my pen;
I write articles here in my den.
Wrote a novel in Provo
But it stank, so de novo,
I've started it over again.

As the diners are donning their bibs
At the barbeque place, I have dibs
On the pork platter (yum!),
Because no one can come
Between me and my baby back ribs.

All the drap'ries are made of brocade—
Heavy silk—what a fortune you paid!
They're a magnet for dust,
So, my dearest, I trust
That you'll go out and find me a maid.

Computer geek, Zachary Phelps,
Is a programmer working on CELPs.
While he's thinking up code,
He will skip down the road.
(You don't have to be mad, but it helps.)

Affettuoso is how you should play it.
I don't know how else I should say it.
To make it appealing,
Perform it with feeling.
When your heart shows the way you obey it.

The upper-class lady who gloats
As she shows off expensive fur coats
Doesn't know that the ermine
Is a weaselly vermin.
She's wearing the skins of dead stoats!

Whom the gods would destroy, they make mad:
Become sad with what should make them glad.
Once crazed, they fear strangers,
Imagine great dangers,
See sin in a three-year-old lad.

The boardsailor ran down the beach,
Then checked both his luff and his leach.
He tested the wind,
And said, as he grinned,
"You can't catch me when I'm on a reach!"

A gasoline pumper am I.
"Fill 'er up!" is what customers cry.
I've filled thousands of tanks;
Though I rarely hear "Thanks!",
I'll a gas jockey be till I die.

While most blokes prefer to feel free—
Unconstrained, left alone, just to "be,"
Joe feels great apprehension
When he's not in detention.
From freedom, he just begs to flee.

As he comes to the end of life's road,
This old man has to creep like a toad;
But no pity he begs,
For he boasts that his legs
May be bloody, but still they're unbowed.

"What does apathy mean? I don't care!"
(Stony silence) "What's honesty? Rare!"
(Still no laughs—what a shock.)
"Here's a good one: Knock! Knock!"
(Lord, that comic is dying up there.)

It's not used when the morning is dawning,
Nor at dusk when the people start yawning,
But the heat of the day
Can be kept right away
From the front of your store with an awning.

Zimbabwe? I still say Rhodesia.
Antacid? That's Milk of Magnesia.
Ask me anything new
And I won't have a clue—
Could it be I've developed dysmnesia?

Acetylenic means having to do
With the bond found in C2H2.
Such bonds are unstable,
So please read the label,
If your reasons for living ain't few.

His coneys contract enteritis.
"It's the bloat!" bewails poor Farmer Titus.
They're distended with gas;
Should it happen to pass
That they die, rabbit stew will delight us.

Barney Beer is in love, it appears,
With a girl who wears D-cup brassieres.
But, apart from her breast,
The parts Barney likes best
Are her conchae: her dear outer ears.

"When my boss said I dress far too young,
I asked, 'Really?' and stuck out my tongue."
"Goodness! You are a one!"
"Well, I do like my fun.
And my boss, well, she's too highly-strung."

A mogul with money and fame
Likes to stay at the top of his game.
At his side is a stunner
(His money had won her).
Arm candy's the name for the dame.

52 B.C.E., you'll recall,
Is when Caesar was victor in Gaul.
Vercingetorix fought
But it all came to naught;
At Alesia he met his great fall.

HELP WANTED: Two men with a cage
For a death match we're planning to stage.
It's the fight of your lives:
One succumbs, one survives.
(We're prepared to pay minimum wage.)

We are struck by our project's illusiveness;
There's no cure we can find for abusiveness.
We keep hoping a way
Will appear any day,
But we're blinding ourselves with delusiveness.

I've a nude scene with Dame Judi Dench!
Lips to lips, groin to groin, we will clench
With great lust as a factor.
(The life of an actor
Beats the hell out of cutting a trench!)

The Beltsville small white was a breed
That was grown to fill customer need
(People's ovens: a place
Where there wasn't much space).
On these turkeys, small families could feed.

If you think that your zoo's lacking drama,
Consider obtaining a cama,
A very rare mammal
Whose father's a camel
And mama's the much smaller llama.

Can you count the dismissals in cricket?
Bowled or caught, leg before or hit wicket,
Timed or run out, retired,
Hit it twice, stumps expired,
Block the field. Got all ten? Then I'll tick it!

U.S. Beach Jumpers, numbering few,
With the minds of the Nazis would screw.
"Fritz, their force is immense!!"
(It was all a pretense.)
Who began it? You'd never guess who.

We are dining tonight Chez Marcel
(Fresh flowers, white linen: it's swell).
All of which paves the way,
Through the Champs-Elysées,
To a passionate nocturne chez elle.

There was a young man from Peru
Whose limericks stopped at line 2.

There was a young man from Verdun
 
 

Steer a sled down a slippery slope;
Or call Geldof and Hoskins and Hope.
Have no shilling to spare
For short, neatly cut hair?
Ask your uncle, he'd never say "nope".

Cool and clumsy,  and round as a quail,
God's experiment: fated to fail!
Might this large, passive meal
Have dodged slaughter? Get real!
Dopy dodos would never prevail.

Limericks written with trowels,
More noisome than movements from bowels,
Rouse wrath near and far.
Clumsy critters, they are
Known as lmrcks (without any vowels).

When they broke — a terrific sensation!
Every concert — a standing ovation!
Quickly signed them to seal
Their first five-album deal!
(Fifth one sucked. Reason was: obligation.)

A love scene that's drippy is cloying;
In slang, it means tiresome/annoying;
And you also could say
It describes a wet day
Full of raindrops the clouds are deploying.

When Nathan procures his acates
He buys foodstuffs at chefs' wholesale rates.
With fresh herbs—by the crate—
Nate makes salads so great
That his guests lick each bit from their plates.

A comparatist's characteristics:
Expertise in comparative linguistics,
Knowing Latin and Greek,
Both to read and to speak,
And a grasp—quite a bit—of statistics.

Here's the bride and the groom, and, oh yes,
There's the bridesmaid, in pastel-hued dress.
She's been here before,
Knows the drill, knows the score.
She's the next to be wed, that's our guess.

Lee is arrogant, yes, autocratic.
His ideas can't be changed; they are static.
When the dogmatist speaks,
We agree or he freaks.
His correctness is quite automatic.

While he carves out a place in the sun,
Marv will struggle—amusement he'll shun—
But his carveout will be
So fulfilling that he
Will conclude work itself has been fun.

My two lips, and my back, and my chin,
And my neck, and my butt, and each shin
Are all covered with this,
What you touch when you kiss.
Dermatography? Treatise on skin.

Bumps and lumps are assigned to me now,
Nothing big that might make you say "Wow!"
I would open your gut
And work miracles, but
As an intern I just don't know how.

We can both disagree, yet not fight,
Though our chance for agreement is slight.
But, between you and me,
Our best hope to agree
Is if you say to me, "Yeah, you're right."

There's a breakthrough that's stirring much awe
Called CRISPR that's now a great draw
As a gene-edit tool —
It's incredibly cool
At locating and snipping a flaw.

I'm from Ulster, so give me a bread
That includes some potato, instead
Of a loaf with just flour.
Hot or cold, I'll devour
Chewy fadge—with some savoury spread.

Fine-grained clay, as a slurry, is vile.
But when shaped into pots, bricks, or tile—
Glazed or unglazed—and baked
In high heat that's unslaked,
Clay is coctile: cooked tile lasts a while.

The waves of the Ottawa tossed
The astrolabe Champlain had lost,
So he couldn't rely
On the stars in the sky
To judge how many arpents he'd crossed

The firemen faced some great harm there,
Responding to some guy's alarm blare.
The reason? No joking,
He fell asleep smoking,
While sitting, relaxed, in an armchair.

Some children in public are brattish,
Obnoxious, annoying, and rattish.
Their behavior is rude,
It's disruptive and crude:
And frankly, they drive me quite battish.

In my life I have never once seen
Any gal wearing fur that was green.
When the furriers plead,
"It's green pelts that we need,"
I'm assuming that's not what they mean.

Our new boss tries to act understandingly
Of the stress we encounter expandingly.
He's calmed down for the nonce,
But he wants quick response,
So he gives out his orders demandingly.

As the truck runs me over, I'm aching,
And that noise that you hear, I'm not faking.
Now my passing is near,
The last thing that I hear:
Crepitation, the sound of bones breaking.

Cook him wieners galore, let 'er rip.
He'll eat lots all at once; he's a trip!
I've seen him, you know,
Eating twelve at one go
(Or as others might say, "at a clip").

The artist who uses chrome red
Is risking exposure to lead.
You'd imagine that paint
Should be safe, but this ain't.
Use an alternate pigment instead.

Change the subject — it's making me sore.
It's ridiculous, also a bore.
I declare it taboo!
Keep it up and we're through,
So don't go there.  Get off it. No more.

The false positive rate of a test:
Crucial facet, but who would have guessed?
Lab says, "Yes", but take care —
The disease isn't there!
Folks get treated, re-tested or stressed.

I've bought 'em, I've sold 'em, I've lent 'em;
That's  amentums, for extra momentum.
These loops may be thin
But they give the spears spin,
So the bloody things go where I've sent 'em.

Zeke, do not be dismayed by the glint
In their impudent faces. By dint
Of the roll that you ate
I have rendered your pate
As an adamant harder than flint.

At our club's AGM: resolution
To increase what we pay (contribution)
For the hall where we meet.
Now a vote must complete—
They're the rules; that's our club's constitution.

At the station, we heard a request:
Have our weathergirl flatten her chest,
As our chroma key means
That she fills viewer's screens,
And her boobs block the states in the West.

Are your kid's grades a notch below norm?
Is his intellect merely lukewarm?
We can help out the gormless—
Their minds won't be formless
When they've trained at Armand's School of Gorm.

Brutus ponders: "I think this eluvium
Has entered my villa's compluvium.
Such a rock-based dust must
Have arrived in a gust,
But it's odorless—not an effluvium."

You can call me a tomboy, but gee,
What I think when I look at a tree
Is, "How high can I go?"
So the first thing to know:
Is it climbable?  Let's go and see.

Chief Crazy Horse, one of the Sioux,
Fought most bravely, his people all knew,
And he led the Lakota,
Won battles—a quota,
Impressive—that Custer would rue.

On a dark, scary bystreet I lurk,
In a part of this town you should shirk.
In the shadows I hide;
From all notice I've shied—
All of this just to get out of work.

Our captain's elected to field,
So our fate, I expect, he has sealed.
This pitch will take spin.
In the fourth we'll be in,
With our weakness on "turners" revealed.

"I'm normally keener than mustard
And not at all flummoxed or flustered.
But I'm getting some gyp
From the bone in my hip.
I can't fight," the old soldier blustered.

Merry Mercy, the wife of Jack Sprat,
For her diet could eat only fat;
Conversely,  the lean
Suited Jack—with a clean
Plate between them, a mercy, no spat!

Though this seasoned smoked sausage of pork
Mixed with beef tastes so good on a fork,
The results of a poll
Found it best in a roll:
That's the frankfurter here in New York.

I rather suspect I've been had on
This loan, where they're using the add-on
Method, not APR.
It's more costly by far?
Mathematics I've always been bad on.

Those shameless campaigners will bandy
Their claims—underhanded, they'll candy
The plans they're promoting
In sugary coating,
Thus making them out to seem dandy.

It requires an arterial shunt
For a curious surgical stunt:
When the humps of a camel,
That oddly shaped mammal,
Are shifted around to the front.

Since danger abounds at ground zero,
There's no need to behave like a hero.
Check the blast line and know
Where it's safest to go.
Just don't carelessly fiddle like Nero.

Ancient askoi were jugs potters threw
On the wheel with a special shape due
To the need to pour out
Olive oil from a spout
And create a Greek roux for a stew.

Please recognize what has occurred:
His control on your world is absurd.
Though at first just your teacher,
He's made you his creature,
Dependent on his every word.

There's a flaw I've just now put my paw on:
Inside straights I seem always to draw on.
I'm a mutt who loves cats.
Friends say, "Leave them!" and that's
A real bone of contention to gnaw on.

Slow down, catch the wrecks on your cell:
Digi-neckers, you're drivers from hell.
While you capture that view,
Help can barely slog through.
And for what? Grisly photos to sell?

As a vegan, Gus Grissom should know
That these stalks keep his calories low,
But his garden's one veggie
Makes relatives edgy.
It ain't NASA celery, so?

To counter a poison, they make
Antivenin—a serum you take
For a chance at outfoxin'
Ophidian toxin,
A killer that comes from a snake.

With the foot soldiers hitting the streets,
Life's less taxing for office elites,
Who avoid the mundane,
Stay in out of the rain,
Asses covered and counting receipts.

Dejection hits every group.
It's that state where your feelings will droop.
Disappointed, you feel
Life is far from ideal.
If not that, it's a word meaning "poop."

Quoth Adam, in deep contemplation,
"Oh, God, what's a good explanation
For my navel and tits,
Which are purposeless bits?"
Shrugged the Lord, "I suppose, decoration."

"What the hell is that stuff called BN—
Something borin' outside of my ken?"
"It's not borin', you moron,
It's a nitride of boron,
I've told you again and again!"

The nilghai's known too by the name
Of blue bull—it's the male who's to blame.
He's a handsome steel blue,
While the cow's a brown hue.
He's the largest in Asia, they claim.

Facinorous, aren't you, my dear?
You're more wicked than anyone here.
You're a dirty old stick,
And it sure makes me sick
When you sneak baby's pee in my beer.

...But when God took a hand in the game,
The construction crew swiftly became
A directionless rabble
Whose speech was a babel
Of lingos no longer the same.

My girlfriend's a catch.  She's a find.
We're a match.  She brings marriage to mind.
She has traits I admire,
And I'm filled with desire
To have both of our lives intertwined.

I'm a cat's-paw, complaisant and mild,
Quite easily conned and beguiled.
How I'd love to be cool
And make others the fool,
But I guess I'm just born to be wiled.

The cultural anthropologist said this:
"Their society's rules seemed amiss.
They'd no art and no dance;
Men wore bras but no pants;
And a marriage was sealed with a hiss."

This limerick's anapest beat
Is both clear and predictably neat.
But be warned — at the end
There's a counterpoint bend:
Suddenly, in a switching of feet.

I was there; now I'm gone. What you see
Is a pale afterimage of me.
Faint impressions remain
At the back of your brain,
But by now I'm halfway to Fort Lee.

See how dew-rot just made its debut?
All your wonderful plants turned to goo.
Too much sun, too much wet:
Biological threat.
It will rot out your horses' hooves too.

This tropical fruit, round and yellow,
Isn't known as a flavor of Jell-O.
Baked breadfruit, in hue,
Is like bread (texture too).
You can eat it while playing the cello.

A huge avalanche? Hardly, though he
(Trump) shouts "Landslide!" So let's look and see.
His electoral race
Was in 46th place
Out of 58 contests. Aw, gee!

Having cytapheresis is known
To yield platelets or blood cells alone
While returning the rest.
Giving blood will be blessed
(And the life you save might be your own).

The Biden rule, as it is called,
Doesn't really exist.  Some are galled
By the thought of a freeze
On Supreme nominees
In election years; voting's forestalled.

It doesn't take much to ignite
A huge flame war. Participants fight
In an online "debate"
Of rude slights — a crude spate
Of ad hominems, venom and spite.

A bandophilist bought a rare scarf
That belonged to the late H. J. Scharff.
But he spied it one day,
To his utter dismay,
Tied 'round Fido, who merely said "Arf!"

No, not decasyllabic, since I'm
Quite confined to use nine for this rhyme.
Stuffing syllable ten
In a line now and then
I'd regard as a metrical crime.

Digladiation means "fighting with swords"
(Or it did, ancient history records).
It's "a brawl," in addition,
Though this definition
Has also since gone by the boards.

It's a mishmash, a hodgepodge cross-section:
A farraginous, random collection
Of art a la carte.
Tell me, how do I start
To arrange it? I need some direction.

When I'm looking straight up in the sky,
I see tiny round objects float by.
They are not, I suppose,
Martian ships, UFOs—
They're entoptic, inside of my eye.

"Let us gamble," said he, with a smile,
"On the toss of a coin: cross and pile!"
When he won every toss,
It was I that was cross;
My whole pile had been lost to his guile!

He awoke to a wailing banshee:
"Ahe-oop, lad, there's just thee and me!"
In great fear he replied,
"Once I get my boots tied
Be assured there will only be thee."

Here's the sad case of Bolton v Stone —
From a six hit, poor Bessie's knocked prone.
There had ne'er been a higher ball.
Club's sued: found not liable
(Risk too remote; breach not shown).

Randolph Caldecott, Chester-born man,
Broke away from his dad's banking plan.
Went to London instead —
Studied art, was well read —
And his future in pictures began.

"Your son's failing," the principal said.
"There'll be no graduation for Ted.
On his head he won't wear
The school's mortarboard. There
We'll be placing a dunce cap instead."

Actress Susan Sarandon I'm filing
Under gals who look great when they're smiling.
True, her eyes bulge a bit,
But I have to admit
That her bug-eyed look sure is bug-eyeling.

When pernicious anemia's crud
(Huge erythrocytes) clutters the blood,
Cobalt vitamin shots
Restore oxygen (lots!)
And nip nerve decay right in the bud.

Once John Denver sang songs of the high
He attained in a cold Rockies  sky.
He could soar like the birds
In his music and words,
But his handmade machine failed to  fly.

The brown bear, being fully beclawed,
In a wink made a mess out of Maude.
Those long nails on each paw
Did their job; what Maude saw
Made her pray to her Lord, "Help, I'm flawed."

Robin, Maurice, and Barry, take care.
Though the Bee Gees' detractors are rare,
It has to be said
You sing more from the head —
The chest register's saved for the hair.

My grandma espouses donations
To a few "save the wombat" foundations.
But her fundraising trails
What's collected for whales;
Seems cetaceans rule public relations.

An animal called bigeneric
Is hybrid, a creature chimeric:
Like sphinxes or centaurs
Half-hatched by inventors,
They're beastly crossed breeds esoteric.

"Let's go leaf hunting," Dad used to say,
"To the back roads for autumn's display!"
To miss foliage season
Was, to Dad, worse than treason:
Miss the pies and fresh cider? No way!

From its name, you would think the gas Freon,
Was inert, just like argon or neon—
But it's not, so the ban
From your aerosol can,
Is a safeguard we all should agree on.

The anemochord's keyboard struck chords,
Which attracted the ears of the hordes.
But the music went flat,
Schnell was out on the mat;
In the end there were no great rewards.

These creatures died out; they're extinct.
Their demise is thought climate change-linked.
What? You saw one last week?
Well, it died—take a peek.
The whole species succumbed while you blinked.

All composite plants form a head
Formed of flowers in clusters, it's said;
But being specific,
The texts scientific
Say they're capitate (mostly) instead.

We hear you're soon off on a trek.
We'll supply your whole fitout—on spec:
Should it lead to a book,
Give our house the first look.
Meanwhile, try not to break your fool neck.

As the guard locked us in, the door clanged
 And this gallows bird said, "I'll be danged
 If I'm not out by spring."
 Most are betting he'll swing.
 Hell, this bastard deserves to be hanged!

The chef shouted "I quit!" in a huff
When I told him his cream puffs were tough.
But desserts must be served,
So I'll fill in, unnerved
At beating this marshmallow fluff.

My daisy, at first, was intact,
Every petal well backed by a bract.
Now my love loves me not,
And my bloom's not so hot:
Rack and ruin in one petulant act.

Each morning, with sleep in my eyes,
I reluctantly, blearily rise
To milk dairy cows Daisy
And Bluebell and Maisie…
These girls hear my dawn-breaking sighs!

Frederick Douglass—reformer with flair!
Silver tongue and brown skin and white hair.
On plantations he'd stand,
Speak for liberty, and
Abolitionize everyone there.

If your right lung collapses, you'll free
Up some space.  (This has happened to me.)
Since my heart had a mission
For dextroposition,
I find now I vote GOP.

You've declared your own personal war on
"The Abies." Invective you pour on.
Using Abe, your attacks
Show a couple of facts:
One, he's Jewish, and, two, you're a moron.

Emblazonry's tough, but I'm trying:
Our shield's colors demand reapplying.
But the detail's too much on
My forebears' escutcheon,
And the hues so intense, I've been crying.

For the British, Britannic's a word
They may see, but it's not often heard.
But with Majesty paired,
It's on stationery aired
As a royal term sometimes preferred.

An overly skinny girl, Kate,
Was dismayed when her "monthly" was late,
'Cause of amenorrhea,
When menses says, "See ya!
I'll be back when you've put on some weight!"

I clapped and applauded the chap
Who came through on the very last lap.
He had shown he'd the knack;
Earned that pat on the back.
"That's a feather," I thought, "in his cap!"

In an arsenal armies will place
All equipment they need for their base.
When they head out to war
They may know what's in store—
But good luck if your shoe's lost its lace.

Philatelists know their stamps well.
Entomologists think bugs are swell.
Musicologists know
Their "Ray, Mi" from their "Doh".
Campanologist?  That rings a bell.

Young man Ernest decried the bust's charms.
His loud shouts tripped the Louvre's alarms.
"That Venus de Milo,
Should be housed in a silo.
Say ciao ciao. Bid a farewell to arms."

"Slim and muscular, octogenarian,
Non-smoking, divorced vegetarian
Seeks marriage post-haste
With a woman who's chaste,
Under 30, a nurse, and Canarian."

For my garden club luncheon buffet,
I was planning a goat cheese soufflé,
But no, I won't risk it.
They might just tsk tsk it,
And I'd have to whisk it away.

Our coach bellows out, with a shout,
What his ball control plan is about.
His football obsession
Is time of possession;
Opponents, defending, wear out.

My trek in the mountains is bliss,
With my well-laden donkey—I'd miss
This renowned beast of burden,
But tell me the word on
Her load—is my ass big in this?

An autogamous plant reproduces
By putting its cells to good uses;
Both species of germ
Cell, the ova and sperm
Are its own, so it has no excuses.

Whereas: To articulate peace
Is our aim (we wish warfare to cease),
Therefore: Now shall we frame
In a treaty, sans blame,
Every step that makes shooting decrease.

I must say this painting is quaint.
A masterpiece — that it sure ain't.
The artist, one judges,
From seeing the smudges,
Just daubed a blank canvas with paint.

After 13 March '38 came,
What was Austria wasn't the same.
For the Anschluss was made—
After that, I'm afraid
That the country shared Germany's name.

There's the secret — or double-O sort.
Thomas Cook? Well that's travel, I thought.
Meanwhile, some are estate,
Some are news and some freight.
Agents act in your interest, in short.

Afrikaners are people who speak
Afrikaans, full of words like fabriek.
They're also called Boers;
Britain fought them in wars
(Though in Africa, that's not unique).

He's so cheap, what a creep, lousy tipper.
He's a cheat, pure deceit, ethics skipper.
How to punish this fraud?
Well, the options are broad:
Have him tied? Tan his hide? Rack the gypper!

When Columbus one day ventured forth,
Lisping, "Thet uth a wethterly courthe!"
He was hardly to know
That his voyage would show
The Americas, South and then North.

Yow! Selene's on the scene? Run for cover!
She's a mayhem and violence lover
Who enjoys drunken brawls,
Kicking guys in the balls,
And the like. Every day is a bovver.

In the realm of the past  ("how-we-were-dom"),
It was said that all males will prefer "dumb
But blonde" — propagating
Dumber folk with each mating.
(This conclusion I hope's an absurdum!)

"It's an aurated statue," I'm told,
So I bid on this figure of gold,
But I break down in tears
When I find it has ears!
"I don't want it," I say.  He says, "Sold!"

In the doldrums means down and depressed.
It's an effort to even get dressed.
In this state unattractive,
Stagnating, inactive,
You feel 'all at sea', stressed and messed.

The fire 'neath the full cauldron crackled,
As the witches surrounding it cackled.
They laughed and they screeched
As the moment was reached
When their magic was fully unshackled.

With just minimal flirting, this chap
Had an angel fall into his lap.
He was caught by surprise
At that bar when her eyes
Said, "I want you."  Sweet love was on tap.

Deviationism marks you a splitter;
Party stalwart turned into a quitter.
The collective has voted
To have you demoted
From the penthouse straight out to the shitter.

What did coconut water provide
To medics that fought on each side
Of the Second World War
When meds weren't in store?
It saved troops who'd have otherwise died.

An esteemable person is hard
Not to hold in the highest regard.
But a sexual transgression
Can leave this impression
Of virtue quite grievously marred.

The Web is so big I surmise
That "The Net of a Million Lies"
Has a number too small
To do justice to all
The deceit — is a googol the size?

FDR had ideas and great drive,
And he wanted our nation to thrive.
He betrayed his own class,
Giving kicks to their ass
And their trust to bring progress alive.

Advantage: position superior
To opponents, who thus have inferior
Resources or skill;
So you, with a will,
May apply toe of boot to posterior.

William Lee is refined, all agree.
And with ladies? Gallant as can be.
An odd nickname, in fact,
Lets you know how he'll act.
It's an adverb: "Bill 'Chivalrous' Lee."

Many brownstone apartments were rank:
Claustrophobic, neglected, and dank.
But astute renovation
And gentrification
Have made them look terribly swank.

Ceylon jungle fowl females convey
A dull camouflage plumage display.
But the males? In my book,
It's a whole different look:
Like a rooster on steroids, I'd say.

So you chose to be legally bound
To this Homo erectus you found.
You thought he'd be hot
'Tween the sheets, but he's not.
On the details you need not expound!

Fido barked, "It's the worst time of year:
The damn dog days of summer are here.
Why did humans defame
Their 'best friends' with that name?
That's a serious question, don't sneer!"

Now it's August, and Dad thinks I sinned in
My internship. What a great wind in
The phone Dad has blown!
Yo, I don't live alone—
I am living in London with Lyndon.

Narcoleptics will just fall asleep—
That's unless they have something to keep
Them awake. They don't try
For a Dexedrine high;
It's their treatment, effective and cheap.

Plan was good, but I couldn't quite pitch it.
Said my boss, "That's a great carriwitchet!
It's a damned funny joke!"
So I tried not to choke,
And replied, "Never mind, I'll just ditch it."

Cerebropathy? Let's make this plain:
You've an illness we can't yet explain
In your gray matter, Sue.
Please, whatever you do,
Don't obsess—keep your mind off your brain.

"Your changing the stations gets old;
Give me the damn clicker to hold."
But he learned at his work
As a government clerk,
"Go through channels." He does as he's told.

My friend's whacko — he's just lost his cool,
And he acts like he's sighted a ghoul.
There is no way to calm him
('Cept maybe embalm him).
"Yo, chill!" I yell.  "Chill out, you fool!"

Please excuse me, as I now divulge
Just why I don't like to indulge
In cake, sweets or booze.
I really must lose
Flab that's causing my stomach to bulge.

Leaving Rome, if your wheels tend to stray,
And what should take an hour takes a day,
And your collies are wobbling
It's due to the cobbling.
You're riding the Appian way!

In the inn, the old woman prepares a room,
On the off-chance some tourist asks, "Where's a room?"
The road to east Turkey
Was bumpy and jerky.
Rides (and rhymes) were quite rough, here in Erzurum.

A field hospital, tents in formation,
Treats the wounded. Its normal location
In a war zone's design
Is behind the front line.
It's a movable, surgical station.

When the bookkeeper tried to divert
Our small company's funds, we felt hurt,
But the charges were pressed—
Now in stripes the guy's dressed.
Our accountant, it seems, was alert!

With ectopia cordis the heart
Forms outside (maybe all, maybe part)
Of the body. Some die;
Birth mortality's high,
And time's short if some treatment's to start.

A reviewer sans fear or remorse,
Total truth was Dot's constant recourse.
"Not a book," she once sighed,
"To toss lightly aside.
You should hurl it with maximum force."

The steam-powered wringer (or mangle)
Was decried as a foolish new fangle.
When it reached its top speed,
The big flywheel was freed,
And it mangled its maker's poor dangle.

The faithful rendition depicts
A reversal, with colorful tricks;
When development halts,
Disappearing assaults
Give a negative, tendered by blix.

That warm cinnamon roll smells just fine,
And this morning, for breakfast, it's mine!
It has raisins and dough
And some cinnamon, so
Its sweet flavor is really divine!

You're a dendrochronologist? Great!
You can help me resolve a debate.
If I saw down this tree,
Could you check it to see
What the weather was like in '08?

Buenos Aires, a city so clean; a
Great game in the Boca arena;
Asados and wine:
My vacation was fine.
So don't cry for me, Argentina.

It's prepared by fermenting some rice,
This nice drink that does not involve vice,
For it's non-alcoholic
And sweet — you can frolic
With cool Amazake on ice.

Put in water to make a suspension?
Its makers might have that intention,
But it clumps into stuff
That a whisk's not enough
To deflocculate, please let me mention.

I've a pair of old words for combustion.
One with two definitions?  Adustion,
Meaning "cauterization
To promote scar formation"
As well. What's the other? Exustion!

Aporia deals with confusion
In reaching a truthful conclusion.
What is truth?  What is not?
Is it substance we've got?
Or is it just passing illusion?

"Colonel Custer! This message came in!"
"It can wait!" — "It's concerning your kin!"
(One's passed on. He should grieve,
Take compassionate leave.)
"Really, Sir, I....!" — "No! Bugler! Begin!"

Euonymus, "well-named", this shrub:
Its twigs served as rod, bolt or hub.
Spindles made from this wood
Were, for wool spinning, good.
Just five lines to describe it? A stub!

My brother Horatio is gifted.
He can fly—like the time he was lifted
Right up to the attic
(He's quite aerostatic)
When drafts in our house slightly shifted.

Amnesiac characters star
In movies whose plots often are
About solving a crime
When one's memory's not prime
While avoiding a booby-trapped car.

June's a certified fool. Here's the proof:
Late last night she climbed up on the roof
And crooned tunes at the moon —
A full fortnight too soon,
At new moon — you'd say June's a true goof.

It's the fight of the season, and all
Watch the boxers to see who will fall.
Between rounds there's a cutie
Who's shaking her booty;
The bell brings the belle of the brawl.

The congressman wanted to hire
An aide who would surely aspire
To a lofty career.
His selection seemed queer:
She was sunny, but no ball of fire.

Censor Appius Caesus would roam
On a via he built near his home.
On this Appian Way
He could honestly say
That from there all the roads led to Rome.

The Bible, some 60-plus books,
Is a bit more complex than it looks.
See, God's Holy Spirit
Affects how you hear it,
But fear it? That's only for sooks.

A melodic objective is set
Which by cello and cellist is met
When their bodies entwine
And vibrations combine
In an intimate, tuneful duet.

John is living with Tim, who's a colonel;
Their relationship's more than fraternal.
They share drink, they share food,
Share their bed, where they're lewd —
All I'll write of their nightly adjournal.

Accomplished fact (or French: fait accompli)?
It's quite simple: If I fell that tree,
It will be irretrievable
And truly believable
That this fact is permanent. See?

In the red, the exposure's the longest,
And attempts to fine-focus, the wrongest.
At the chemical focus
(A violet locus)
The action of light is the strongest.

A breast pocket on clothes is the best
Place to put things concealed and at rest.
Any shirt, coat, or blouse
Can conceivably house
Something covert (kept close to your chest).

With the shape of an overturned hull,
They were steel and they shone (never dull!).
They had flaps to guard cheeks,
Sometimes visors like beaks—
Thus the burgonet covered the skull.

You're thinking that bank-dwelling bird?
But in Autumn '08, you'd have heard
Many banks give up moans
Over real estate loans —
One hard swallow as losses occurred.

Lyndon Johnson was proud of his beagle.
Lifted 'Him' by the ears — was that legal?
To the average joe,
It was almost as though
He had trashed the American eagle.

When grammarians golf with their peers,
They'll imbibe a few cases of beers.
So accidence happens,
And even the tap-ins
Are missed midst the voices and cheers.

To decapitate — decapitation —
Can occasion the odd reservation.
Politicians may dread
The removal of head
From the flesh, corporation, or nation.

Super party, but... boy, what a mess!
I'll help clean, but I can't in this dress.
Let me first change my clothes,
Get a mop (and a hose?),
Then the damage we'll start to assess.

Up the Empire State Building, there's
A climb of some 2,000 stairs.
And on Floor 102
There's a deck with a view
(And a heartbreaking shortage of chairs).

A breakwater jutting from land
Gives the shoreline a chance to expand,
And a beach will be built
Of alluvial silt,
As the waves don't erode all the sand.

The detectorist combs depths, not heights,
Seeking hidden metallic delights —
Buried cutlery, buckles;
Wow, discarded brass knuckles!
Trash is treasure; just lower your sights.

If ad baculum's how you endorse
A position, you'd best change your course.
 When of reasons you're short,
 Your debate lacks support,
So you try to persuade folks by force.

Said Gerald, poor golfer (and wit):
"I was dangerous — tempted to quit.
Things could not stay the same,
So I raised my whole game —
And now fewer spectators are hit."

"You've dysphagia: your intake's impaired,"
Said the doc. Now he's gotten Mom scared.
"How I fear this condition
That hampers nutrition.
I can't swallow that!" she declared.

If the Church or the Vatican dares
To meddle with Government's cares,
Conclude a concordat
For keeping the Lord at
A distance from Caesar's affairs.

I'm Elvis's number one fan.
I had every recording the man
Ever made. Now I find
Graceland's vault has been mined
Once again, a perpetual plan.

An auxiliary verb, I would say,
Is a word that could help every day.
If you will, it's a term
That might mean that you're firm:
When you do have a will, there's a way.

"It just needs some water," she said,
As more plant food was spread on its bed.
She cannot comprehend
Why the plants she may tend,
Despite round-the-clock care, remain dead.

I had suffered a wedding day blitz.
First I woke with a face full of zits.
Then instead of "I do,"
My sweet bride said, "We're through."
Double whammies like that are the pits!

For five decades my darling Nicole,
As my wife, has made everything whole.
Her presence transcends
The dark that attends;
Her hand serves to cheer up my soul.

Our new series Thumb Warrior Fights!
Shows on network TV Sunday nights.
But our syndicate dreams
Won't include Netflix streams.
NBC owns the digital rights.

I was bending my elbow alone
In a bar where I wasn't well known,
When this drunkard named Lyle
Bent my ear for a while:
Two straight hours of "Moan, moan, moan, moan"!

I've got cage biter syndrome, it's true,
From the bars that I constantly chew.
Since the day I was shipped,
All my teeth have been chipped,
Yet a day or two more and I'm through!

The teacher said Bradley had fabulated
Too many stories. She'd tabulated
Tales in her log —
Dubbed Brad's Homework v. Dog —
Which explains how Brad's labrador Abdul ate it.

To deboard: to get off, to debark,
Like the creatures who left Noah's ark.
Zebras fled at a trot.
Insects crawled from the spot.
Glad the ark found a good place to park.

The reason you're athetoid, Fred,
We think was that blow to your head.
Now the problem's your hands—
They don't follow commands.
They're unsteady and writhing, instead.

Your cranial sutures, it's said,
Are the joints that are found in your head.
While they're soft in a youth,
In an oldster (God's truth),
They will harden — but stop once you're dead.

There's some ore here, but mighty poor yield:
Bits of float have washed down to your field.
So the bedrock up yonder
Is something to ponder.
In situ, there's more left concealed.

The captain blew up when he learned
Of the brawl between sailors, which earned
A consectary trip
To the side of the ship
Where he keelhauled all parties concerned.

He's exposing the family scandal;
His father's a thief and a vandal.
He has called the gazette!
Every word seems a threat.
It's an article mother can't handle.

It's a smoothly carved stick, on a string,
Whittled down round the edge like a wing.
When you swing it around
It will spin out a sound:
It's a bullroarer. Hear the thing sing.

William Gambel set off on a quest
Hunting plants. This was at the behest
Of Tom Nuttall, his friend,
Who'd decided to send
Him with orders, "Young man, travel west!"

Jimmy bought me a dress of fine dimity.
The fabric for me was sublimity.
All my girlfriends agreed
It was smart. Guaranteed:
'Twas the first time we'd reached unanimity!

Dead and wounded? / And risks—what are they? /
To get help there, just what's the best way? /
Where's it at? / What's the need? /
What's occurred? / It's agreed
That this all is summed up with CHALET.

This reporter's a dumb, mixed-up scribbler.
Try to edit his work? He's a quibbler.
When he covered the sport
On a basketball court,
He wrote: "Gibbs needs a bib; he's a dribbler!"

All my nerves are exploding, it's true!
And they're blowing their cellular goo!
This loss axoplasmic
Is truly orgasmic—
You sure are one hell of a view!

You asked for an antibiotic,
But your pharmacist's so idiotic!
That prescription you chugged
Left you spacey and drugged—
You mistakenly took a narcotic.

Confronted with stone formed from mud,
A diluvialist might blame a flood:
"This terrain underwent
An extensive event."
To most others, the theory's a dud.

I use basswood, and wield a sharp knife;
I carve rustic-style, based on real life.
As I cut, chip, and pare,
This one gives me a scare —
It begins to resemble my wife.

Long before Epicurus professed,
"Live for now; let your lust be the test,"
Aristippus made pleasure
His primary measure,
Expressing the blessings of zest.

"Here, it's mink!" So my trauma begins.
My palms sweat; I feel faint; the room spins.
Doraphobia is,
In the phobia biz,
Fear of fur or of animal skins.

A contradistinction will matter
In comparative critical patter.
If you're always so fast
To compare and contrast,
Then this word gives a blast of the latter.

Either both of the pair, or one earring
Had a habit that wasn't endearing.
When I'd open the case
I'd find just empty space—
Not a trace. Were the jewels disappearing?

Recognition is owed to the label
That's employed in a database table.
Got a file you must find?
The descriptor assigned
Is what's bloody well making you able.

All blackmailers, modern and olden,
Keep victims abjectly beholden
For goods they have tendered,
Or services rendered,
But, most of all, silences golden.

In the skull of a mouse or a gator
There's a membrane that's called dura mater
For protecting the brain.
There's the pia—that's plain—
But the dura's the harder and greater.

"My back teeth," cried Cassandra, "are floating.
I'm pretty damn near to exploding."
She'd put off nature's call,
So she — quick — grabbed a stall
And proceeded with bladder unloading.

If your task's new equipment to fit,
But you don't have the skills or the kit,
Use a fitter who's got
All the tools you have not,
And success-wise you're sure of a hit.

Here are sculptures of goddesses: Luna—
She's the moon—and her neighbor, Fortuna,
Who brings luck, bad or good.
Pray to her if you would
Gain largesse from this female kahuna.

I've got horns and more brawn than Mike Tyson,
But a "buffalo"? Oh  no, not I, son!
Call me bison and then
Call me bison again:
Those taxonomist guys named me twison.

Can't you see that I'm trying to work?
Shut your piehole!  You drive me berserk!
Your continuous yammer
Will get me the slammer,
For canning it for you, you jerk!

At age eighty, my sins I repented;
I lamented and then felt contented.
Since that day I've forgotten
Those deeds that were rotten,
But I'm saved (though I'm somewhat demented).

All those memories, when life was a blast —
No one knew that our clocks ticked so fast!
We were once, you and me,
Little ova-to-be.
That's an ooblast, man, from the past.

Since the seafloor dives down at the edge
Of a continent's plate, I'd allege
That the surface gets scraped,
And the scrapings reshaped
To produce an accretionary wedge.

With American soul to its brim,
Copland's music sings out with proud vim!
His oeuvre amazes,
Deserving all praises.
His "Fanfare" is almost a hymn.

Crashed cratons? A smashing idea!
Gondwana preceded Pangaea.
Supercontinents past
Seemed eternal and vast,
But then tore like a soggy tortilla.

Bioaerosol: pollen or spore
That's propelled by the wind, left to soar
From its source, i.e. beast,
Plant or fungus or yeast.
You have dandruff? That's gross (but one more).

Transformation to queen from a trollop
Can be measured in terms of a dollop.
The chances are slim,
And the outcome is dim.
The idea is naught but codswallop.

Bulwer-Lytton wrote tales oft retold
'Bout a Round Table hero, so bold:
He, with skin black as coal,
And with rage in his soul
Was a dark stormy knight to behold.

Came two knocks on my door.  I was shocked.
Called, "Who's there?" and was glad it was locked.
Heard the answer "Nobel."
"Nobel who? Please do tell."
"No bell. Else I wouldn't have knocked!"

We have crossbred a pig and a cow
(Accidentally—don't ask me how).
It produces with ease
Bacon, burgers and cheese,
While, surprisingly, going meow.

As the prophets would say, "It was written."
One look at her face—I was smitten.
And the touch of her paw
Made me marvel in awe,
Though the cat was still only a kitten.

"This criterion-referenced exam
Tests anatomy knowledge. Don't cram.
If your score is below
85, you don't know
Your own ass from your elbow…" Oh, damn!

To this genus of germ—Escherichia:
By mistake I, last week, took a lick o' ya.
Now my gut's tied in knots
And I've bowel movements—lots.
Just begone from my paunch, bug. I'm sick o' ya!

Fine calligraphy's pencraft and stroke,
And for learners, the awe these invoke.
Our scribe Luke would instruct us
On each symbol's ductus
By example; old Luke never spoke.

Crack the code, and I could make a mint.
All I need is a tiny wee hint.
The Clitoria vine
Holds a signature sign,
But the book says it's not fit to print.

As to avian pie: not sure why,
When they're baked, blackbirds simply won't die.
But I do get bemused
Since they oft get confused;
These two dozen sang "Cottleston Pie."

When I'm out, my extravagance shows
In my chic ghetto fabulous clothes.
They're flamboyant and gaudy.
I'm tellin' ya, Lawdy,
These duds are a hit with the hos.

I buy birds in the colors of booze;
Combinations affect how I choose.
My latest's a parrot:
Chartreuse and deep claret—
Grand drinks and such contrasting hues.

Say "ab urbe condita". Why?
It's what A.U.C. means to imply.
Count from Jesus' premiere:
Rome was built in that year
Minus DCCLIII.

Chronic bladder stones plagued Sam'l Pepys.
Unanesthetized (gives me the creeps!),
Bound, held down, it is known
He was cut for the stone.
It was worth it, despite later seeps.

A divorce judge's rulings provide
Who gets assets and who is denied.
Human nature, it's sad,
Means we rarely have had
Just agreements: those fair to each side.

We physicists, wasting no erg, all
Spent a lazy day fishing with Fergal.
We were left in the lurch
By those thieving blue perch
Known as chogset and cunner. Oh, burgall.

I have signed in advance a directive
That will make this decision prospective:
Stop the drugs, say goodbye,
Pull the plug, let me die.
Living wills can be very effective.

Should we countermand orders that flout
The Geneva conventions? No doubt!
Yet our chain of command
Lets those waterboards stand.
Could it be we're expecting a drought?

For some time now these two have been dating.
 Their families and friends now awaiting
 A wedding date, then
 After marriage is when
Going steady becomes legal mating.

In the pillow where Gran laid her head
Was a feather crown—there, on the bed—
Shaped by angels, some say,
For her last placid day.
She'd be welcomed, the mass clearly said.

Eye candy is often a feast.
It is beauty that brings us, at least,
Something sweet to admire;
But I'm bound to inquire
Why it's so often paired with the beast.

Going crabbing, we're fishing for crab.
Now I wonder how many we'll grab?
There's so many, I hear,
By the bay, at the pier,
We can make a crab salad that's fab!

A persistent demandress, my Tess —
She required an answer, no less.
She insisted I tell 'er
(I'm now 'er ex-feller)
"Is my bum getting big?" — I said yes.

Uncle Maxwell is going to die,
And a lifetime of drinking is why.
An unreachable goal
From his youth took its toll.
Ads had told him: "Drink Canada Dry."

When my hot cappuccino's denied me,
I am steamed. I must have it inside me.
Please beware of my ire.
My need is quite dire.
Espresso/foamed milk, or else hide me!

Some people may think it obscene
To have more than one way that you lean,
But for soap it's idyllic
To be amphiphilic:
Loving water and oil is clean.

Product quality bad?  In a hole?
Job in danger? Things out of control?
Set stat limits. You'll see
All it takes is just three
Standard devs, and your head will not roll.

As a fosterling child I was raised,
Since my parents had died. God be praised
That some folks were aware of me,
There to take care of me
(Others did nothing—just gazed).

We can furnish a way to discard
Wooden chairs that are hopelessly marred,
Whose appeal has been dwindling:
We'll chop them for kindling
That burns in our furnace 'til charred.

A person of some foreign race
Or a little green being from space:
Whatever their kind,
In each case you'll find
An alien's not from your place.

All the CPACers took a straw vote
To see which one would captain their boat.
Mitt and Sarah were mauled
And were clearly a-Paul-ed.
All the libs can just sit back and gloat.

In our time, many poems didactical
Are in jingles in ads—very practical—
Played again and again,
Till they stick in you brain.
Ask the adman; he'll tell you that's tactical.

Beef tallow is rendered from suet.
It isn't a big job to do it.
Just trim a cow's fat,
Toss it into a vat,
And then turn on the heat source and brew it.

Her beauteousness has been waning.
That weight that she lost she's regaining,
There's warts on her snout
And her hair's falling out.
I'm no catch so I can't be complaining.

If not made right, your jelly won't gel —
Doesn't set, just stays syrupy. Hell!
It won't sell at the fair,
But don't pull out your hair:
Add some pectin — it should come out well.

"I'll be naked" (a message from her)
"At the restaurant beneath my fox fur."
But en route she is cowed
By an anti-fur crowd.
Don't you hate when these things co-occur?

Balky boss? Leave him just as you found him.
Use the press—make an end run around him.
You'll enjoy his chagrin
When he's forced to give in.
Then back off; his "good luck" will astound him.

Grace, I'm drained.  Yeah, I'm bushed, I'm exhausted.
All my energy's gone — seems I lost it.
What a hellish long race —
I wound up in last place.
And that finish line, Grace?  Barely crossed it!

New annoybots are flooding the Net.
They act mostly like humans, and yet
They post nonsense and flames.
This is one of the games
Childish hackers enjoy, I would bet.

I'll say this — and I'm very emphatic —
With Schmeck's tech drawing skills I'm ecstatic.
Detailed graphics and charts
Show how all design parts
Are related; he's diagrammatic.

My amplificatory remarks
Will expand on those made by the narcs:
Keep your children at home;
Don't allow them to roam.
There are drugs being dealt in our parks.

Shakespeare's plays were adapted by Verdi.
If you know which three operas, you're nerdy.
Here's some hints for your brain:
Think fat knight, Moor and thane.
Whether spoken or sung, they're quite wordy.

A bourride is a stew made from fish,
Lots of garlic, and egg yolks—delish!
That's what everyone wants
When they dine in Provence:
It's a dish that's a gastronome's wish.

A break-in can mean a test run
Of your show; it might really be fun.
In your dwelling, a break-in
Might leave you quite shaken—
If the guy who breaks in has a gun.

To enhance and embellish and sweeten
Its image, the posh school in Eton
Is known as a college.
We're forced to acknowledge
Tradition can never be beaten.

Though a carman is found in a car,
A carboy is different by far.
It's the large, bulky vessel
In the lab you might wrestle,
While acids you pour from this jar.

Death was faced beneath treacherous skies
With no lifeboat to answer their cries;
For, with waves on that scale,
Any rescue would fail;
And each fisherman met his demise.

What a lexical puzzle is dord.
It's a word meaning "density"? Lord!
Etymology? None.
This will surely be fun—
Such a mystery must be explored!

Seems an editor made a mistake,
And so dord's not a word but a fake.
"D or d"  was misread
On a note card, which led
To an error that sure takes the cake.

Please explain why the opposite sex
Rarely acts in the way one expects.
'Iggins mainly complains
That the feminine brain's
So bewild'ringly strange and complex.

That the bleep was invented's good luck;
It's quite useful when censors are stuck.
 Any word they don't like
 Can just go take a hike,
So your virgin ears never hear [bleep].

Please stare at this verse versatile,
And focus on form but not style.
Then close your eyes next —
Did you still see this text?
An after-image lasts for a while.

Two spoked wheels, a small seat and a chain,
And a frame make a bicycle: plain,
But effective. Astride,
Pushing pedals, you ride
Till your bum says it's time to abstain.

Call me fat, if you like. You can judge—
I don't care. I'm in heaven. Won't budge
From my seat, where I eat
My rich chocolate treat,
Till I've finished this whole pound of fudge.

She wore jeans to the formal, it's true—
Not just trousers—her jacket was, too,
Made of heavyweight denim.
The critics, with venom,
Declared, "Dear, this outfit won't do!"

I got praise for the A's that I earned,
But when later, for A's, I was spurned,
My conditioned response
Became bored nonchalance.
In extinction, a pattern's un-learned.

A Patagonian cavy named Otis
Said, "Rodents my size attract notice.
I hop 'cross the steppe;
Gals sigh, 'Fourth-largest—yep—
That's a fine hunk of prime Dolichotis.'"

When a black-hearted blackguard named Jack
Found a bedbug had bitten his back,
As the bug wasn't budgin',
He reached for his bludgeon—
An impractical tactical tack.

Fill the dishpan with water that's hot,
Add detergent, and what have I got?
It's the station I man—
Clean each plate and each pan;
It's my regular post-dinner spot.

I've a pistol I keep out of sight,
A derringer, tiny and light.
No blast-you-out rocket,
It fits in my pocket —
My block's somehow safer at night.

Biologism has its attractions.
It examines society's actions
(Both our women's and men's)
Through biology's lens;
It explores our accords and infractions.

How I love thee? I'd need to condense
What I feel into five lines intense.
I could mention thy beauty,
Sweet voice, sense of duty,
Deft wit, polished manners, good sense . . .

Mrs. Lincoln reacts with dismay
To an interview, held on the day
That her husband had died:
"So, the shooting aside,
How was Lincoln enjoying the play?"

Tiny creatures, afraid of the light;
In your closet they hide, out of sight.
No frequenters of galleries,
These shy little calories
Sew your clothes ever tighter each night.

Said a nanotech expert named Kirk, "It's
Through ball bonding microchips work. It's
A minuscule melding,
A ball-to-wire welding,
Completing electrical circuits."

Ailuropodidae on your veranda?
Look at that! Holy cow! Giant panda!
Don't look so surprised;
You should have surmised
When he sent you those twelve memoranda.

Evolution will do what it must,
And advergence is part of that thrust.
It produces such things
As the elegant wings
In which skylarks and bats place their trust.

Continuate viewing may cause
Many folks hooked on serials to pause
When the good guy has won
And the bad guy's all done:
They may yawn and switch over to Jaws.

Control tower to pilot in flight:
"Your traffic's a Fokker, turn right."
As he expertly veered,
He gleefully jeered,
"I've got the li'l Fokker in sight."

A reader of Marx and Voltaire,
While doubtingly starting a prayer,
Said, with heavenly glance,
"I must look, Lord, askance—
Your existence is up in the air!"

A wiseguy, though bawn in New Yawk,
Was delivered, he claimed, by a stawk.
His accent (that means
"How he spoke"), straight from Queens,
Sounded awful whenever he'd tawk.

The annulose structure of trees
Helps scientists date things with ease.
The rings give the gauge
To determine the age,
And plant cellulose makes it a breeze.

Though my triumphs can gleam almost prismally,
My efforts will sometimes fail dismally.
While you might not know beans,
You'll know just what this means,
If I've done more than write this abysmally.

We were out on the pitch when a fellow
Fell down, and then said with a bellow
While lying inert,
"Ref, I'm not really hurt!"
Thus the man drew a caution (a yellow).

While thinking things calculatory,
My mind turned to things somewhat gory:
If two cannibals chose
To sauté twelve men's toes,
How many could eat cacciatore?

"An ailurophobe — ugh," my cats purr.
"Your new girlfriend is worried our fur
Will cause wheezes and hacks
And allergic attacks,
So you shan't cast us Persians on her."

Getting groans about grains is such fun;
It's a pleasure to make a rye pun.
Corny jokes are the best!
You're amaized and impressed?
I'm not done—heck, I've barley begun!

Expunction's a word for erasing,
Removing, discarding, effacing
That which, after completion
Of the present deletion,
You may or may not be replacing.

Black Power, the movement he led
As a Muslim, American-bred,
Lost a lot of its soul
In the fight for control;
Malcolm X, by three men, was shot dead.

The Houses of Parliament's tower?
Or the clock there, as some will avow? A
Mistake used for either,
Big Ben's really neither —
It's the bell that rings out on the hour.

The working-class men made a stand:
"Our charter lists every demand —
Let the vote be the norm!
Social justice! Reform!"
Swiftly, Chartism spread through the land.

Our mess is my friend's bread and butter:
She's a counsellor focused on clutter.
Shall I warn her, with tact,
If we clean up our act,
Then she may well end up in the gutter?

Acrotheca's an obsolete genus
Now called Fonsecaea.  Between us,
Some species, in doses,
Cause chromomycosis:
I'd keep them away from your penis.

You've a penchant to lead men astray
By devoting to each just one day,
But I find it distasteful,
Repugnant and wasteful
To use men, then throw them away.

Fred and I are frequenters of inns.
Every day we will stand on our pins
At each bar, with a glass
To our lips. We surpass
Other clients: the booziest twins!

He's been watching old re-runs all day,
Giggling loudly (well, more like a bray).
He's unhinged, incoherent,
Deranged and delirant.
Take that man in the mirror away!

I egosurf all night and day
Just to see what dear Google will say
About me and my fame.
I click... there's my name—
On the Top 10 Most Wanted display.

A dibber makes holes in the ground,
A most useful tool, I have found.
Also known as a dibble,
Of that I won't quibble.
From those holes seeded growth will abound.

If you call it a dit it's a dot (·),
A fact which must not be forgot.
And  a dash (–) equals dah —
Have you got it so far?
It's  Morse code and I used it a lot.

The First Pet is a dog of the seas;
The puppy's well-bred (without fleas).
His master he'll greet
With furry webbed feet
(And I hear that he barks Portuguese).

Oily cacodyl — arsenic-based:
Its mere vapour can kill if misplaced.
In dry air, it is just a
Spontaneous combuster.
Blackens tongues, smells of garlic — don't taste!

If your hostess  decides to be sneaky
And offers her own cock-a-leekie,
Make sure she is not
A legitimate Scot
Before you say something too cheeky.

While divorcing, she called me "demonic",
A term that was truly ironic;
She's one of those ladies
Who came outta Hades,
So she'd be the one who is chthonic.

On his buddy Pratt opted to fink;
He informed on his friend in a blink —
Saved himself. Indeed, that
Proves that Pratt is a rat!
Yeah, his self-serving morals sure stink.

I'm off to the dentist today.
He'll examine my teeth, and he'll say
That dreaded word cavity—
Dental depravity!
Drilling, he'll fill while I pray.

"Get more exercise; eat much less fat,"
Said the bishop. "My mission is that
I reduce, in this diocese,
Cholelithiasis
(Gallstones)." Thus ended his chat.

A curmudgeonly Brit's muttered claim:
"Litigation is common law's shame!
The barristers' trust is
In winning, not justice.
The adversary system's to blame."

The decision was made. Dad was jarred,
As the news kind of caught him off guard.
He was speechless with awe.
Now he can't practice law,
As the truth is: my dad's been disbarred.

In the play, I was lettuce abed,
Though I longed for a lead role instead.
But when I inquired,
Alas, I got fired —
I should quit when I'm clearly ahead.

Adventitia is tissue, like skin,
With nerves that are running within.
It's a coat on the wall
Of a vein, that is all.
Like the casing on sausage, it's thin.

On a visit to see my friend Tammy
(The most talented chef in Miami),
I was lovingly fed
Fried cassava-based bread.
It was yummy! She called it a bammy.

Your cheek's wet, Betty—why do you fret? It
Is true that you've sunk, through your credit
Cards, deeply in debt.
You're upset at the threat
Of a bankruptcy? Pet, just forget it!

I'm a butcher. My friends call me Dan.
I'm a fish-cutter, flesh-cutter man.
My new slogan is neat:
"You cannot beat my meat!"
With my butcher knives, nobody can.

I'm just lying here covered in sweat,
'Cause again it's so givey, so wet
That I long for real rain.
What the hell; why complain?
Up in Boston, it's snowing, I'll bet.

"An unstoppable runner, they say,
But we'll double-team Johnson today."
To cover all bets,
Both the Packers and Jets
Blocked that man. ("We got carried away.")

Take -9, -1, 7, …
Or -4, 1, 6, 11, …
Add, each iteration,
A constant—elation!
Arithmetic progressions are heaven!

We soar up in a basket of wicker—
Huge balloon overhead, pounding ticker;
Then with deft aerostation
And smooth navigation,
Drift back safe, glad to open our liquor.

I've a cabinet (really!) of yaks.
You can tell that they're yaks by their tracks.
Now, as strange as that sounds,
We are speaking of nouns
Called collective. They're penned, so relax.

He's a fledgling insurgent, it's true,
But he's under my wing, so don't stew.
Though he's new to this fight,
He's both stalwart and bright;
He can help us to hatch a new coup.

My teddy bear, whom I loved dearly,
Was named Astroid because he was clearly
The shape of a star.
And that's it, there you are,
He was star-shaped (I miss him sincerely).

Disglory's the state that I find,
But Versailles is a French state of mind.
So I'll start World War Two —
Bid the treaty adieu —
Let the cheese-eaters watch on the rind.

At the nightclub I wanted to hog a
True beaut of a gal. I went gaga:
I got instantly passional,
Foolish, irrational;
But her beau (jealous ape!) nixed that saga.

An amorous waiter from Rome
Had no patience to wait in his home.
He wanted love now,
He didn't care how —
He'd even make love to a gnome.

Rainbow's ends and the hues in-between
Light your pots, each one sprouting a bean.
From the garden's reaction,
The spectrum of action
Shows nothing will grow in the green.

Said the vicar, "That fish that they're landing
Is so good it deserves its own branding.
I suggest they might say,
In a biblical way,
'Piece of cod passeth all understanding'."

The Akkadian god they called Ashur
Was a handsome imperial smasher,
Distinct from the other gods,
His Mid-Eastern brother-gods—
More powerful, stronger and brasher.

Is the cormorant (common) a shag?
Is it known to lay eggs in a bag?
Mr Isherwood's verse
Is misleading or worse,
But researching the facts? What a drag.

There's no doubt you're a qualified rotter,
But you lack needed skill as a plotter.
Now your life's in a tangle,
Your wife you would strangle.
You had  best find a first-class garroter.

The Five Stairsteps, five sibs, made a name
For themselves when "O-o-h Child" became
A big hit, and ten more
(R&B charts) would score,
But that's it on the pop charts—a shame.

Little gecko, up there on the ceiling,
You're a lizard I find quite appealing.
As you run up the wall,
Never seeming to fall,
I am filled with an envious feeling.

Sharing blade roast along with a chat,
They chewed gristle as well as the fat.
Their strong points of view,
And the cut of meat, too,
Came straight from the shoulder, just that.

Cell to mate: "My defense is in line—
I'm intact, undissolved, feeling fine.
But when bacteriolysin
Binds, dearie, all is in
Hands that are stronger than mine."

When beset, back in late 1940,
By sortie upon German sortie,
Said Churchill, "No quittin'!
This Battle of Britain
Will teach them to not be so naughty."

My daughter is ill; I can't leave her
To visit your golden retriever.
We just bought a new cat
And resulting from that,
She's in bed with the dread cat scratch fever.

Lord Macbeth's wife near drove him insane.
"You're a dimwit, you back-order thane.
Find Duncan and spurn 'im,
Then stab 'im or burn 'im.
Would you rather be called "dunce inane"?

The geologist spoke from his podium:
"There is nothing expensive as rhodium,
While it's perfectly clear
That darapskite's not dear—
It's a hydrated salt made from sodium."

When my knee was both aching and pulsant,
I requested a gentle demulcent.
What you sent was repulsive—
The drug was convulsive;
It caused me to seize—a convulsant!

Remember, please—always accessorize.
A turban will nearly caress your eyes.
A well-chosen belt
Will make you look svelte,
And that way will speedy success arise.

Said the duck to the man, "What a shame.
You just missed. You should work on your aim."
Said the man to the duck,
"That was only bad luck.
I will get you next time. Are you game?"

Why's the boat from Arabia named dhow
So admired from the stern to the prow?
'Cause her nice, open waist
Seems designed for men's taste:
It suggests a bikini-clad Frau.

As the window will open and tilt,
Early lettuces grow and won't wilt.
A cold frame will win
By keeping warmth in—
It's recycled, or else custom-built.

Daddy Daddy, we can't eat no more.
You're not listening — our tummies are sore!
Your behavior's cross-purpose —
You gotta come burp us —
We're upchucking lunch on the floor.

It's a blight on my record, I fear,
That our voyage is ending right here.
There is naught I can do
With our mutinous crew.
That's abundantly, bountifully, clear.

"Are you Franklin (gulp) W. Dixon?"
Asks a lad. "The real writer?" he sticks in.
"Gee, us boys in between
Ages 8 and 14
Find your tales of teen sleuthin' transfixin'!"

Jimmy Cagney did not say the line
So oft-quoted. It's mimed as a sign
Of physical roughness
And gangster-role toughness—
But close, and it suits him just fine.

A decreasingly jaundiced young fellow
Grew gradually less and less yellow,
But increasingly green
As he eyed his colleen
Most mistrustfully (cf. Othello).

On inspecting Ed's teeth, long neglected,
The dentist observed, "Pulp's infected
In lots of teeth — six.
Endodontia's the fix."
That is why, I suspect, Ed's dejected.

Coming early in Robert's campaign
Was a gaffe that he couldn't explain:
"Adolf Hitler? How sad.
He was not all that bad."
And his chances went straight down the drain.

A didrachma's a two-drachma piece
Made of silver. Used where? Ancient Greece.
Could a Sparta-based carter,
Unwilling to barter,
At a drachma apiece, buy two geese?

Gengineering's such fun, you'll agree.
Clone a mate; make a multiple me.
Build a babe in a dish
At our lab. If you wish,
Pair Gen X with Gen Y for Gen Z!

This hat's cordovan colored: dark rose,
Or oxblood, just like these new hose.
It's the shade of my jacket
(The suede with the placket),
Which matches the zit on my nose.

A catalogue comes  every spring.
It has pictures; I order; they bring
Tiny seeds that my thumb
Can poke in, till it's numb—
Then watch earth do its magical thing.

The hue of your outfit is peach,
Both the skirt and the top—I love each!
If you want them made white,
Please decolor them right
By employing a delicate bleach.

Beryl Cook taught herself how to paint;
Captured ladies who showed no restraint.
Gave us humour and glee
From a life that's lived free.
She was home by the sea ... now she ain't.

Got an overweight rocket? That's bad.
To help it lift off from the pad,
Add a booster or two—
When it streaks for the blue,
You can bet that makes astronauts glad.

Lucas County).  I bet that you'll grin
At this joke: Who there dwells
Behind bars in white cells?
They're called Lucasites.  Get it?"  "I win."

Jack defended, while Bob would attack.
They made England light up
When they won the World Cup
In the team that drove Germany back.

If your Fido's "Fidelio's Song
Ima Teapot," now don't get me wrong,
But pound puppies, for me,
Beat the whole AKC
(That's American Kennel Club) throng.

With a temp of a hundred and three,
I moaned, "Call a mortician for me."
Now today, ninety-nine
Is the figure. I'm fine,
Since my fever has broken, you see.

Ted's diamond seemed really first-class,
From its crown to its sparkling culasse,
And I wanted to wed,
But my dad shot him dead
When he found it was made out of glass.

I was told by the government man,
"There is now a new federal ban
On asbestos, you know.
What you used must all go.
Remove it asbestos you can."

These days when we think of air travel,
It causes our nerves to unravel.
Those security checks
Can turn folks into wrecks —
I doubt there are many who'd cavil.

The camelopard, strange-looking beast,
Likes to reach to the treetops to feast,
For his neck is so long
That it looks a bit wrong—
Any pills that he takes must be greased.

If you've burnsides, there's hair on your face,
And it covers your cheeks; in this case
The style's muttonchops' kin.
With a clean-shaven chin,
You've a real nineteenth century face!

Silly Guy (and his friends) once played  boules,
In a field full of cowpats (the fools!).
First he swung, then he flung,
Then he slipped (in fresh dung),
Then he fell head-first (splat!) 'tween two stools.

It's a gimmick, as everyone knows,
Used by Ingres and more, I suppose,
But with pencil in paw,
I am able to draw
What the camera lucida shows.

If you study the boats on the bay
Near this capital's harbor, you'll say,
"Setting sail, Annamese
Are as free as the breeze
And enjoy saying 'Anchors Hué!'"

Bread and circuses served to allay
Discontent on the Appian Way,
While today we pay bread
(At a hundred a head!)
To get happy at Cirque du Soleil.

Accipitrine hawks have short wings
And sharp beaks used for shredding small things.
In woodlands they prey,
Fierce killers in grey,
Used in falconry—passion of kings.

Don't mention to Brits you're a clerk
In agro-industrial work,
Because aggro can speak
Of a violent streak,
And they'll worry you might go berserk.

For this comment, I do beg your pardon:
Your life is no walk in the garden.
Cerebrosclerosis,
Without being verbose, is
When both your brain's hemispheres harden.

This cubebic solution's a beaut,
Made from twelve cubic inches of fruit.
It should placate the sore
That I've tried to ignore
In my prostate. (It hurts when I toot!)

My classmate and I went to sea.
As a shipmate I knew he would be
Not a very brave guy—
But then neither am I—
In the casemate we hide, him and me.

Barking dogs — every size, every kind,
Run around in my brain. I'm inclined
To admit I'm obsessed —
They will not let me rest.
Doctor, please help me dog-proof my mind!

Sam the Swagger just vanished today.
A friend harboured him, letting him stay
In his house for a bit.
The police must admit
They've no clue where he's hiding away.

'E lies prone on 'is whistle, the coot,
And 'e puffs on 'is little cheroot.
As 'e blows rings of smoke,
'E be low, this 'ere bloke,
For 'e loves to be flat on 'is flute.

His good looks and fine manners? Appealing.
I would never have guessed he was stealing,
But our audit, revealing
The facts, set me reeling.
Now I'm feeling the need for Darjeeling.

How'd the Alamo come to be known?
'Twas a mission in ol' San Antone.
On a line in the sand,
Volunteers took a stand,
When their orders said "Leave it alone."

BGH is absorbed smooth as silk;
Causes cows to give one-tenth more milk.
A synthesized hormone
(Not what makes Lenore moan) —
Might be nasty, like some of that ilk.

The all-nighter, perfected in college,
Is finals week's shortcut to knowledge.
To cram for the test,
I'll forgo any rest.
Gotta read this entire antholog...

A cicero, typesetting-wise,
Is the name of a character size.
Whenever you strike a
Font just above pica,
M. Tullius' ghost will arise.

Adonean I'd look if my face
Weren't a mess as is clearly the case.
'Cause as long as a hose
And as slack is my nose —
Let's face facts: it's a total disgrace.

This tough stuff's dissolvability's low;
It into solution won't go.
I say let's do a test
With this acid  — the best
Dissolution solution I know.

China's national animals wait
To have babies. Their chances aren't great.
First, the dragon's a myth,
And the panda says, "With
My own kind I'm not eager to mate."

My teacher, she wasn't impressed.
I got everything wrong on the test.
Yeah, I flunked the exam
Cuz I am what I am.
I'm a lazy-ass jerk, so I guessed.

Aye-aye, sir, your jet's set to zoom.
Back in port, I'll reserve you a room.
There's a spot that will do
At the base BOQ.
You've no spouse or SO, I assume?

I must curb my desire for Annie;
Be discreet, ease the heat, and ca'canny.
Disguise and discretion
Obscure my obsession—
But my God! What a glorious fanny!

They're protesting in Cairo once more.
Egypt's capital hears the crowd's roar.
Arab Spring soon ran dry
When they picked the wrong guy,
But the army showed Morsi the door.

When trying to stay off the booze,
Disulfiram's what you should use.
If you drink it will make
You regret your mistake—
When you vomit all over your shoes.

David Beckham has earned lots of fame
Since he first started playing his game,
And great bundles of cash
That he keeps in a stash
To support his four kids and posh dame.

At the pole, all the stars circle round;
Not a one of them dives underground.
But in Ecuador's sky
(If you ask, I'll say why),
Circumpolar stars cannot be found.

Bragged a nerd, "My computer's preferred."
Having heard this, a second nerd stirred:
"Well, I'm no defeatist —
I'll trump that elitist!"
Shrugged a third, "Those two nerds are absurd."

It's certain the eye is the situs
Of pain when you have choroiditis.
Severe inflammation
Can cause aberration
In sight, with acute uveitis.

Is Hester in truth to be blamed
For her sex games which cannot be named?
Good vibes? I confess
I would rather know less.
If I blush it's because I'm ashamed.

Aintab was attacked by crusaders,
Fought back, and repulsed the invaders.
Now it's Gaziantep,
And a place with a rep
For pistachios, textiles, and traders.

In the cargo bay1 stayed the bay2 Ray
While the greyhounds were baying3 all day.
Held at bay4, Ray would neigh
To the bay5 water's spray,
As the boughs of the bay6 swayed away.

When I die, it's my lawyer who bears
The duty to close my affairs.
But I love a good joke,
So I'm gonna die broke
And leave laughing while putting on heirs.

Without help, Granny cannot go potty.
Conversations with her are quite spotty.
She is losing her wits:
Yes, her mind's gone to bits.
I'm afraid the old bat has gone dotty.

I've a wheat farm.  I fear in my gut
An old scourge that is called covered smut—
Not a sex magazine
But a fungus that's mean
And makes many a bunt ball or butt.

Talking price means you cannot afford
That new pad that your wife has adored.
But if you've got the rent,
Tell the world what you've spent
So your status your friends can record.

If there's blood in the water you'll see
How the predators circle with glee.
Sharks, piranhas and such
Do not need very much
For 'to be' to become 'not to be'.

They grow their own spices and teas.
They make their own clothing and cheese.
They don't borrow or lend;
On themselves they depend.
Autarkic they are, if you please.

There is Angel Soft, Kleenex and Puffs —
Facial tissue that cleanses and fluffs.
It can slurp up a lot
Of excreta like snot,
Blood and spit, that your slimy bod sluffs.

I've crown jewels to sell you—regalia,
With gems in the paraphernalia.
You might find the price high.
I'll explain to you why:
These belonged to the King of Australia.

We were wishin' our academicians
Would attempt to adjust to conditions,
But they claim to be right
In all things. That's our plight:
We are blighted with blind dogmaticians.

The Aussies on Facebook are sad,
Having lost the best goat that they've had.
"Liked" by millions of blokes
For his bleating good jokes,
But for me, they were only "Not baaad."

A Gallagher fan, my friend Rob,
Says, "A dial's an adjustable knob
Like the ones on TVs."
There is one, though, he sees
That's marked "Brightness" that fails at its job.

I'm avoiding inviting Pandora:
She's erosive—we're flayed by her aura.
My guests grow uneasy;
Some, unglued, flatly queasy.
Last Easter, she wilted the flora.

I suffer from allergies. (Geez!)
Seeing hives filled with honey, I freeze;
Please spare me from oceans
And leafy green motions,
For bees, seas, and trees make me sneeze.

Achtung! Alles Lookens und Peepers
Muss Fingers und Mittens off keepers!
Computermachine
Musst nicht touchen, just seen!
Watch the Blinkenlights, hearen the Beepers.

I'm invited by Fred to coedit
His limerick book, but I dread it.
I figure that jerk
Will make me do the work,
And then he will preempt all the credit.

Three A.M., I'm alone and I'm fried,
And it's drizzling and frigid outside.
I'm not greedy; it's need,
So I beg, whine and plead.
But it's useless; I can't bum a ride.

An ode that I wrote to a Grecian
Earned a word from my prof, on completion.
Was it excellent?  No.
It was excernent, so
My long ode, he thinks, bears on excretion.

The old botanist, losing his grip,
Offered leaf lectures all through our trip.
Leaves are simple and round;
Or they're pinnate, compound;
Or emarginate: notched at the tip.

Though, for some, winter blues are unfurled
When it's dark, I'm contentedly curled
In a comfortable nook
With my laptop or book,
Thinking everything's right with the world.

The Butler Report well defines
How in Britain our press still declines,
For to label it "whitewash"
Is, being polite — tosh.
Today, few will read 'tween the lines.

"Tell your pal he can't drink in my inn.
He don't move. He don't speak. Not a grin."
"He's from Finland.  He's fine.
Though he'd rather have wine,
Fix the Finn catatonic a gin."

Now my wife is expecting, I've got
A long list that begins baby's cot
And ends, if you please:
University fees.
Seems I'll have to fork out for the lot!

Yell "Hostess!" and get laryngitis;
Be cramped in your seat with arthritis.
It's often a pain
When you travel by plane.
Oh, the pressure!  I'll get aerotitis!

Collectibles: things of a kind
Such as Hummels, or teapots you find.
But the space that they use
Gives my sweetheart the blues,
So it's coins to which I've been inclined.

Dinoflagellates, mostly benign,
Ply the seas with flagella.  Some shine.
When they bloom by the trillion
And tides turn vermillion,
Don't order the clams when you dine!

A drag is a wagon or dray,
Or a horse-driven cart full of hay;
And the drag, I proclaim,
Is the popular game
Of purloining from drags, by the way.

A downhole's a vertical hole,
Whether dug by a human or mole.
It's a shaft through the soil
When you're drilling for oil,
Or you're mining for diamonds or coal.

There once was a dish (wed a spoon),
And a cow that could jump o'er the moon,
And a laughing dog who
Saw all this sport through.
Did a cat really fiddle a tune?

Core countries are those who have means,
Higher wages, armed forces, machines.
Their peripheral nations
Provide the plantations
And labour; they often have beans.

An animal act at the fair
Featured bears that were covered with hair.
When performing their dance,
They wore tutus and pants,
So I asked, "Can't you bear a bear bare?"

The Baltic States: one is Estonia,
Which, with Latvia, took in Livonia.
Lithuania's next,
Making three — all quite vexed
When the USSR said,  "We own ya."

Oh, my old English prof was a joy.
Witty figures of speech he'd deploy;
As, when hoisting a drink,
He once said, with a wink,
"Metaphors aye be with you, me boy."

There's a Turk and a Cypriot fight,
And it's hard to say who's in the right;
For the name of the game
Is to alter the name
Of the sweet once called "lumps of delight."

Opportunities?  Boy, were they there!
But for only so long did she care
Till they vanished.  I blew
All my chances, which flew
Out the window and into thin air.

My first time in the dock, I was tense,
And my lawyer lacked all common sense.
He said, "Son, we're conceding
You're guilty of speeding.
You'll likely get death — first offense."

For a bigamist, more than one wife
Should result in a full-of-bliss life.
But that plan has a flaw:
That's two mothers-in-law,
Which translates into "double the strife."

If alone, that will doom a have-not.
Get more people, then give it a shot.
Though you may not be guys
Who have ample supplies,
Make the enemy think you've a lot.

I bought a new tortoise today
For a coot with my stud Billy-Ray.
But it's turned out a joke
As the "girl" is a bloke,
And now both of the buggers are gay.

Good Lord, what a gangrenous glare!
So I lied; why the hell do you care?
Pour this stiff a stiff drink;
He thinks his shit don't stink.
And judgmental? Oh, please, give me air.

Ahinoam was bride to King Saul,
Bearing some of his sons, but not all.
The others were carried
By girls he'd not married,
Who slept in a room down the hall.

I bought a new chopper last night;
Had to bury the old one from sight.
Seems the neighbor cat's missing
With his yowling and hissing—
He put up a mighty good fight.

The lump's going down and relief
Is in store to displace all my grief.
Meds alleviate pain,
Bringing sun 'stead of rain.
I'm so lucky my grief was so brief.

Her prose isn't bound by constraints:
Deep-dyed villains and out-and-out saints,
Poorly limned, undercooked.
Still, the last time I looked,
She'd grown rich—no regrets, no complaints.

When I want your opinion, I'll say:
"Don't be shy!" or perhaps "Fire away!"
"Tell me what's on your mind!"
If you do, I may find
I agree with your plan; it's okay!

Let us sail to the harbor's fanal.
It's a truly inviting locale.
How the old lighthouse gleams,
Sending lifesaving beams!
Just to see it, it seems, boosts morale.

The bank job my friend pulled has netted
Ten million, and now I'm beset, Ted,
As the cops' fingers fly,
Point to me as the guy
Who was not at the scene, but abetted.

Put him down? That decision's no trifle.
He's injured below his right stifle,
Right here on the gaskin.
But please stop your askin'!
It's minor, so put down the rifle.

You may notice this plant in a ditch:
A vine sporting prickly pods which
Can inspire one to scratch—
Thus its moniker—natch!
The cowitch gives cattle the itch.

Babbling idiots talk just to hear
Themselves talk.  From each topic they veer,
Like my prof who's inept.
It's a wonder he's kept
On the faculty year after year.

Californios longed to be free
Of their Mexican rulers; their plea
Was for clear independence.
Their rancho descendents
Are now all Americans, sí.

When you pilot a plane, day or night,
And you don't want a truncated flight,
Just be sure that you tell
Other planes "ASL"
When you're asked your location and height.

When you're peevish and feel like a grouch,
It will help to lie down on a couch,
A divan, or chaise longue.
I will not steer you wrong.
You'll feel better.  For that I can vouch.

She'd waited and hoped; got betrothed,
But most wedding apparel she loathed:
"Bridal veils I won't wear!"
"But the children will stare,"
I advised her. "Though nudist, wed clothed."

Bottom-feeder: a creature that might
Find its food at the bottommost site
Underwater, near ground,
Or the fellow who's found
In the Taco Bell dumpster at night.

Greek Agathon's loaned dungarees
Came back to him torn at the knees.
His response with no worries
Of twitting the Furies:
"Euripides, Eumenides."

The bagpipeless piper was sore.
He yelled loudly, "Now, this I deplore!
Why would pilferers filch
An old bagpipe worth zilch?
Has my bagpiping been such a bore?"

When the weather gets hotter and torrider	
And winds become savage and horrider,
Advis'ries are clear,					
Number twelve for this year: 				
It's a hurricane heading for Florider.

Urticata is not really acne;
Still I hope it'll never attack me.
This allergy comes
To the lowest of bums
And the finest of men, William Blackney.

The Inspector declared with a hiss,
"The nicker of knickers found bliss
In the Mews, but left clues
And will soon get his dues.
We'll get to the bottom of this."

Days of gala we fête in great style:
Fill all fountains with bubbly. Meanwhile,
Costly firework displays
Can go on many days,
And we shoot any guest who won't smile.

Coups de maitre, it seems, are routine
For the chef who makes fancy cuisine.
This divine cordon bleu
Is a masterstroke, too,
And it came from a vending machine!

I'd never say ewe, dear, to you!
Though you're female and wooly, that's true.
If I called you a sheep,
You might answer me "BEEEP!"
What the BEEEP hides? I'm sorry, no clue!

I would play Highland games till I wilt
Were it not for the way that I'm built.
Oh, I'm up to the labor
Of tossing a caber,
But how would I look in a kilt?

Pascal's mortal foe, a great rascal,
Declared, "My life's pinnacle task'll
Be to kill you (a crime),
In two Passovers' time."
Cried Blaise in amazement, "Dipaschal?"

If a pressure group tries forcing through
Some pet project abhorrent to you,
Checks and balances make
The proposing group take
Up a much more considerate view.

Hardened plates coccolithophores wear
Are called coccoliths. Why they are there
Is a topic of doubt.
If they figure it out,
I suspect that I still wouldn't care.

"Tasty cheese in a pancake, a blintz is
A dish that can captivate princes.
Learn to cook! Be proactive!
Great cooks are attractive!"
Says Grandma. Her logic convinces.

France's pride, the bemedaled LeClaire,
Stood erect with his nose in the air:
Gave the boche a defeat
By attacking tout de suite,
And so earned his deserved Croix de Guerre.

It's been true ever since I was young:
I'm apivorous, so I've been stung
On my fingers and thumbs
And my lips and my gums—
But those bees taste so sweet on my tongue!

After Mass I asked, "Leftover bread
That's been blessed—chuck it out?" Brother said,
"As last Sunday I showed ya,
Ya numbskull, eulogia
Is left so the poor can get fed."

Obama is crooked, I preached
In a book, and he should be impeached.
I just know they were pissed
At The Times when its list
Of top books showed bestsellerdom reached.

Insanity? Heaven forfend.
But alas, it's no use to pretend.
What was sheer intellect
Has been totally wrecked.
I'm afraid he's gone right 'round the bend.

I'm employed to evaluate wine,
To distinguish the base from the fine.
Some bouquets are so heady
I'm rendered unsteady—
A drag, but the burden is mine.

Every vector's expressed, and with ease,
By a linear combo of these.
They're a basis, the source
(Independent, of course)
Of a vector space—certain to please.

While communing in NATO's top circle,
Trump decided to dump on poor Merkel.
He ranted and raved,
Like a leader depraved,
Behaving as any dumb jerk'll.

Those with doughtiness always are brave—
Think of Spartacus, rebel ex-slave.
Also: Churchill, Mandela,
And maybe that fella
At Wrigley who won't do The Wave.

"I'm not sure whether I can stay strong,"
Yogi sobbed as he spoke to the throng.
"I feel so bereft
Now that Boo Boo has left."
He said, "Bearably, I'll get along."

Campanulate: "shaped like a bell"
(Be it pepper or flower or shell).
At a camp I attended,
Each afternoon ended
With dinner bell rings and a yell.

Should we wash them with soap or detergent?
Our opinions are clearly divergent.
Though our viewpoints collide,
We had better decide—
Being out of clean dishes, it's urgent.

Dolly Parton was put to the test
When she fell off the boat with no vest.
Her huge boobs were displayed,
And they came to our aid
When  we dragged her ashore, two abreast.

Simple plants, here at home on the loam,
That are lacking in xylem and phloem,
Are constrained to be short,
Like a moss or a wort.
A bryologist sort brings them home.

A burgoo is a spicy thick stew
Made with mixed meats. Kentuckians do
Add, at times, an opossum
To make flavors blossom,
But I'm like, chacun à son goût.

At the ball Arthur's queen begged her pet,
"Won't you grant me a gay minuet?
My lissome Sir Lancelot,
Come, let us dance a lot!
A little knight music, quartet!"

In this verse, I'll be spinning a yarn
About cows, and I don't give a darn
If they're Galloway, Brahman,
Or something more common.
They all can be found in a barn.

My cooking's so bad, people run.
But this cook-off was different: I won!
How'd my undercooked fish
Beat a fine gourmet dish?
Very simple: I showed them my gun.

Cystometrograms—useful for those
Who just cannot control urine flows.
You must pump folk up first,
Till they think they might burst,
And they're full when they pee on your toes.

Here's Prudence, a bit of a prude,
Who has never been seen in the nude,
Keeping eyes tightly shut
While she's baring her butt,
On the chance that she'd find it too lewd.

What's fanlike resembles a fan—
Not a rooter, a team-loving man,
But a halibut fin
Or your cards, playing gin,
Or, when folded, my curved omelet pan.

As a sculptor in metal and plastic,
I just love what all shapes anticlastic
(A potato chip, say,
Or a saddle) convey,
Curving opposite ways.  It's fantastic!

Elimination is ruling stuff out,
Like opponents, or foods that cause gout.
Through a process thus named,
Apprehensions are tamed
By clinicians, expungers of doubt.

"Carpe diem!" you'd carp, for good measure,
Interrupting the leisure I treasure.
Now I daily get seizures
Of guilt when my leisure's
The subject of all your displeasure.

All Bill's tickets were counterfeitly printed.
I'd have bought some, but Mindy had hinted
That something was strange:
When he'd given her change,
All the money was counterfeitly minted.

Switch it on: electricity flows
As a current called amps and it shows
On a meter. But then
Multiply it by ten—
You've an abamp (that's when the fuse blows).

Though reluctant at first, full of shame,
She soon yielded, and joined in the game,
For I knew how to please her.
And so, just like Caesar:
I saw her; I conquered; she came.

On movies, where scripts have FX,
It indicates special effects:
For example, a death-ray;
Or CGI breath, say.
Doug Trumbull's were better than sex.

Exaltation we know; its reverse
Is abasement, perhaps, but there's worse:
The humblest condition
Is exinanition—
Self-emptying. Just like my purse.

Time just doesn't matter to me,
So I labor asynchronously.
Now I think that I'll take
A short well-deserved break...
I'm back — but my clocks don't agree.

I just love to sound clever and smart.
Faking knowledge is one useful art.
So I never ask, "Huh?"
I just yawn and say, "Duh!"
Like I knew all the stuff from the start.

They found him collapsed at the dockside.
Hypertensive, he took diazoxide.
To revive him they tried,
But the poor fellow died—
They'd administered carbon dioxide.

If it's edible, go on and eat it.
If it's frozen, you might want to heat it.
If it's moving around
You may still have to pound
It, or smack it, or whack it, or beat it.

My inquisitive golden retriever
Killed a beaver and now has a fever.
So I'm giving the bitch
Acetanilid, which
Is a fevered retriever reliever.

On a corbel, unburdened and blighted,
A monstrous black raven alighted;
Then it vaulted and flapped
To a second and mapped,
With its arc, where an arch had been sited.

Catechismal instruction's by rote.
The robotic responses, I'd note,
Have been purposely styled
To brainwash the child
And sever the freethinker's throat.

Our choir is gowned in black serge.
As the priests all process and asperge
Us, we open our throats
And sing the sad notes
Of the dirige (old word for dirge).

Is this cheese insufficiently drunk?
No, that's just its odd name. Have a hunk.
Barely Buzzed has cachet.
If you've heard someone say
Utah can't make great cheese, that's just bunk.

My mother once said, "In a pinch
You should never give athletes an inch,
Or they'll sure take a foot!"
But this question I put:
"Who would want athlete's foot?" (with a flinch).

When a voice on the phone, keen and bright,
Says, "Get rich! Change your life—from tonight!"
And investments you make
All turn out to be fake,
You've been conned. Feeling stupid?  (Too right.)

Rachel sandwiches centered Cee's plate
Amid mounds of egg salad so great
That filled Cee with delight.
It took hours that night
To deliciate in deli she ate.

There are bands which play music all night,
And some others hold barrel staves tight.
One small band is a cell
That comes rushing pell mell
When there's massive infection to fight.

Enology happens to be
A subject where knowledge is key.
Like, who knows what to plant?
Or which grapevines you can't?
That little old winemaker, me!

Said the doughboy from Georgia named Lee,
"I was happy to be in Paree.
The women were fine,
And so was the wine.
The Great War's  now over for me."

What's our theme for next Sunday's debate?
What key issue will folks highly rate?
"Love trumps hate" should suffice.
Nah, that sounds way too nice.
It's a duel. Let's hit hard: "Trump loves hate!"

We play dreidel games down on the floor.
She exhales on her top, ups her score.
I think cheating is bad
So I'm furious, mad.
I blow my top — now I'll win for sure.

Once a poor man would make a small cough
If he needed to speak to a toff.
In that now bygone age,
Men would expertly gauge
When to lift up their headgear: to doff.

All my life, I can't seem to walk straight.
My steps curve, and the trait is innate.
Dad responds to this curvity
With angry protervity,
Says, "Walking in circles? Your fate!"

They think the old pit has been mined
To exhaustion, but one day they find
A new face to be cleaved.
Every miner's relieved
That they're finally out of that bind.

A hasty young husband from Reading
Awoke to find crabs in the bedding.
Add the burn in his piss,
And his conjugal bliss
Gave way to regrets for the wedding.

Seeking work, when I surfed "a job scene",
Up popped "aJ: obscene" on the screen.
Geeks, while clutching small tools,
Posed and measured their joules —
But times 10-18.

The reforming of global finance
Was the aim of their meeting-led dance.
Were the members the key?
Should there be 33?
Would they listen to me? Not a chance!

Paddy's accent is thicker than stew—
I just can't understand him; can you?
His thick Irish brogue
Has gone quite out of vogue,
But he simply won't spit out that shoe!

"An excitant," said Mandy, "is brandy.
I like it much better than candy.
As a long drink and fizzy
It won't make me dizzy;
Unblended, it's making me randy."

I'll be darned if I'm trod underfoot
And I swear that a stitch as I cut
Won't stop my repair;
I will mend all this wear.
I'll be damned if on foot I'm not put.

If they're stylish, my car will come crashin':
I mow down the well-dressed; it's my passion.
Till it's cancelled some day,
Car insurance will pay
For my trend-smashin' — after a fashion.

Republicans gave him much love;
And his office was high up above.
But he mangled each word
And his plans were absurd!
He was awful, when Bush comes to shove.

It's an isle now belonging to Italy,
Where Boney was banished. He wittily
Ordered peach Melba
While living on Elba.
This cannot be true, but reads prettily.

A croustade is a shell or a puff
In which bakers put minces and stuff.
As for those filled with fruit?
Shoot, there ain't no dispute—
It's of these I just can't get enough!

A sponge who is learning to fence
May appear not ambitious, but dense.
Could it properly lunge
Without limbs? Would a sponge
Grasp a foil any way that makes sense?

I love when I come out on top.
I command you — you'll cower, you'll hop.
You're not close to my prominence.
Kneel to my dominance!
Power is mine — I won't stop.

It's been said if you're born with a caul
You'll have talents the world to enthrall —
Second sight, wealth and fame,
People hailing your name —
But it's just superstition, that's all.

Is his aura of wit an illusion?
His double-talk causes confusion.
And  how then, forsooth,
Does he handle the truth?
From his words we can't reach a conclusion.

All my symptoms are still unabated,
And aspirin is contraindicated.
I will sue.  This I vow,
'Cause I've Wry Syndrome now.
Don't you say that it isn't related.

Eccentric? That doesn't half say it.
Maggie's fitified frenzies betray it.
As occasion permits,
Sure, forgive her her fits.
It's her manner. Just don't underplay it.

She'd worked hard for promotion, our Sue;
She was getting impatient and blue.
But then one day she jumped up,
Cried, "Hey! I've been bumped up—
Here's my key to the manager's loo."

In the hall there was laughter and din
As the act sang of poor Mickey Finn.
After each naughty verse
(Each progressively worse),
All the crowd, for the burden, joined in.

She flew through the air with such ease,
My Aerial, named on the breeze.
But as she got older
And more like a boulder,
'Twas Areal—ground—if you please.

The shock waves spread out from the center,
As I witnessed the blast with my mentor.
We could see the brisance,
And I thought, for the nonce,
Of his grief as this A-bomb's inventor.

These are anableps (tropical fish).
Call them four-eyes, if that is your wish.
They can see (this I love)
Both below and above
(That's concurrently) while the fish swish.

While I was out having a facial,
I talked of our abbey palatial.
I spoke (out of habit)
Of abbess and abbot,
Thus making my gossip abbatial.

The judge on the bench had his way,
So you're headed for Botany Bay.
New South Wales is a gaol
That can make a heart fail—
Say goodbye to your life, not g'day.

In the dog pound they place every stray
That the dogcatchers nab every day.
Each needs friendship and love.
Take one home. God above
Will your kindness reward—every way.

Senior moments won't make me feel old
'Cause I'm sharp as a tack, bright and bold.
Uh, what's that you say —
It's my birthday today?
Oops! It looks like my memory's on hold.

I just love dirty girl scouts.  It's not
What you think; if it's Baileys you've got,
Crème de menthe (green or white)
And some vodka on site
With Kahlúa, then give it a shot.

The Automats went out of fashion —
Too bad! When you put all your cash in,
A window sprang open.
Eyes wide, you were hopin'
Your nickels fulfilled your pie passion.

"You were part of the plan from the start
And are clearly of criminal heart.
Although you weren't the one
Who was holding the gun,
You are guilty, young man, art and part."

Yassor Noe was so filled with caprice
He moved eighty-nine times with Denise.
He loved this house, then not,
Changed his mind on the spot;
Fancy that! — Now they're living in Greece.

A buttercup squash seems, to some,
To resemble the shape of a drum.
So why give it that name?
Is confusion our aim?
The term buttercup squash is just dumb.

If a knight stands erect in a field
Demanding his quarry should yield,
His eschutcheon, wings high,
Is a bird, soon to fly —
That's an essorant charge on his shield.

To write lim'ricks, to me, is a fight.
So, to win, I seek words that are right.
I don't care how much time
I use looking for rhyme
But, once done, I sure hate to rewrite.

Skunks are sleek, with a tail like a plume.
But the badger skunk tail's like a broom.
With his hog-nose (no snubs),
Conepatus grubs grubs,
And he really could use some perfume.

My pleasures are earthborn and plain,
Picking flowers, still damp from the rain.
Mother Earth, born your slave,
When I lie in my grave,
I'll be earthdied, and grow with the grain.

In a movie of '80s renown,
The gigawatt's thus broken down:
It takes 1.21
To get time travel done.
(That's according to Doc Emmett Brown.)

My new flat's on the seventeenth floor,
And I worship the lady next door,
But in 1608
There's a harpy I hate;
It's that neighbor downstairs I abhor.

A zoologist friend from Osaka
Wrote a poem in praise of the paca.
But the critics weren't sure—
Called his work immature.
"Immature!" he cried, "That is just ca-ca!"

OT prophet Ezekiel said
To the Lord, "These dry bones, are they dead?"
Lord God said, "Well, they're dry,
But I promise when I
Breathe upon them, they'll praise me instead."

Dvalinn gave dwarves runes when bored,
And with Durin he crafted a sword,
Then made Freyja a necklace.
(Odin's mistress was reckless,
For with each of the four dwarves she scored.)

The Australopithecus clan
Were an ape-like precursor to man.
They could walk (well, they loped)
And their foreheads were sloped—
Sounds a lot like my cousin Dianne.

Smelled you coming an hour ago, bub.
Don't just dabble your face, use the tub.
A few splatters of wet
When you're reeking of sweat?
Soap your carcass all over, and scrub.

SEC regulations OK
12b-1 fees as ways to make hay:
Wall Street funds can take shavings
Each year from your savings.
You've no say in these charges; you pay.

You hear "cardiologist's dream."
Butter, Parmesan cheese, and some cream
Make Alfredo sauce rich,
But my arteries don't twitch—
Deep-fried lard is a bit more extreme.

In shipbuilding, cross-spales are spaced
'Cross the frame to ensure it's all braced.
Each provisional strut
Is first measured and cut
And secured; then the deck beams are placed.

What's this Beetle Drive?  Good British fun
(I.e. long and drawn-out).  It's begun
Not by heading off far
In a small German car;
But you do have to start rolling one.

You say that your health care is free?
Nothing's free.  You can state you don't see
Any charge for your care.
You're perhaps unaware
That they sock it to people like me.

Sporting rubber, resemblant of wood,
Your balls SMACK just as hard as balls could.
Black and rigid, you roll
A tight ebonite bowl —
Very vulcanised rubber-made-good.

A monk at a Carmelite priory
Kept an itemized day-to-day diary.
He tracked, without rest,
All the things he possessed,
Then confessed to a life of acquiry.

I went back to square one — had to halt
And start over.  A prankster at fault,
I knew, when I tasted,
My efforts were wasted —
The sugar container held salt.

The insight that struck my mechanic
Was revealing, profound—epiphanic.
After several false starts
Using Japanese parts:
"Hey, a Volkswagen uses Germanic!"

My tale has a gorgeous young hooker,
But a cannibal tribe wants to cook her.
Then a pirate attack
Wins the heroine back—
It's a shoo-in, Mum says, for a Booker.

What with lipstick and rouge, and such stuff,
My sweet honey looks comely enough;
But with smudges and wear,
She dabs makeup repair
From her compact, with powder and puff.

My journey had only begun
When I ran for the Senate—and won!
But the sessions are tough,
And I can't get enough
Of the recess: adjournment is fun!

Centre-right: keep tax low; keep trade free.
We'll promote wholesome values, though we
Will accept immigration
(With strict limitation)
And gays (if they'll keep it low key).

On the floor, our sorbet-like dessert.
For the cleanup, we'll use this old skirt:
We expect that its twill
Will absorb all the spill,
While its surface adsorbs all the dirt.

At the Playboy Club, working each day
(Or each night, if you put it that way)
I serve drinks, but can't force it —
Bend down in this corset?
A bunny dip earns me my pay.

The censoriousness of his sermon
Had his congregants nervously squirmin'.
"Don't arouse the Lord's ire,
Or you'll face hellish fire,"
Said a fierce evangelical German .  .  .

An acuminose leaf's not your friend,
Since it's narrow and flat at the end.
If you're stuck in the woods
Without papery goods,
Wider leaves are what folks recommend.

Every candle and lamp is ablaze
For a festival lasting five days.
So for most of a week,
Jain and Hindu and Sikh
Know Diwali is sure to amaze.

Send me home, sir, it's all a mistake;
In this boot camp no boots do I make.
Yes, I'd planned to learn boots —
Not to run torture-routes,
Nor by bugles be startled awake!

In the Roman invasion of Gaul
The defensors, undisciplined all,
Badly armed, poorly fed,
Were by amateurs led,
But at two metres each, none was small.

An aristo's one of the posh,
With a title, a mansion, and dosh;
And a daddy and mummy
Whose accents are plummy
Who always say "spiffing" and "gosh!"

A loud message adorns her caboose.
In pink flocking, her butt proclaims "Juice"
In raised letters. Unfair!
Though she's sweet, you're aware:
Make a move and you've cooked your own goose.

I don't care, you can say what you please
About what the birds do, and the bees,
But that won't make it so
For my ancestors, no!
They didn't descend from the trees.

The Aylesbury's a kind of white duck,
Though I can't say I fancy its luck.
It's a good meaty bird
And it is, so I've heard,
Quite remarkably easy to pluck.

Abyssinians lived on the Nile,
A people of substance and style.
Where their kingdom was grand
Ethiopians stand—
In a land where survival takes guile.

You klutz! You have chipped my good urn.
It will take you a year just to earn
Enough money to pay
For the damage today.
Yes, at times it is costly to learn.

A ballisto- type cardiograph,
When in use by the medical staff,
Measures blood through the heart
By the way that that part
Causes muscle jumps just like a laugh.

"Your head's on the chopping block, Fred." —
It's not just getting canned that I dread;
I so angered my boss
That I'm facing a loss
Execution style  — "Off with his head!"

If Shakespeare has somehow amassed a
Sufficiently large plate of pasta,
He won't shout "Enough!"—
Extra serves to rebuff—
You're more likely to hear him cry "Basta!"

First there's Rocky, then II, III, and IV,
And then V for those fans who want more.
Last there's Rocky Balboa.
I swear I don't know a
Consection that's more of a bore.

For Elvis' breakfast, one rule:
He thinks waffles and eggs are good fuel,
But considers hot porridge
Disgusting for forage.
Each morning he hopes, "Don't be gruel."

He sang me a sweet alborado
At dawn, but he sang with bravado;
It wasn't romantic,
But seemed rather frantic,
The way Koko wooed in Mikado.

In the Soviet days, we would watch a
Widely televised Communist "gotcha"—
Where a disfavored member
Would retire (in December?!)
To his summer home, known as a dacha.

Before I ingest antischiz-
ophrenia drugs, my brain sits
In a jar on the floor.
But I worry no more;
Now my skull's where it comfortably fits.

Each girdle and sturdy brassiere
That he makes is considered premiere.
This foundational giant
Puts the squeeze on each client—
He's fashion's top-drawer corsetiere.

A buck passer's one who excuses
His errors with rank he misuses.
If the buck's passed to you
There is grief to ensue,
Since you'll be the guy he abuses.

This curved shape's called convexo-concave:
Rounded sides, just the two, to engrave.
See the moon, fresh and new—
There's a crescent to view
As it sets 'neath the land's dusky wave.

Ex-car nation: we've run out of fuel;
No services; transport by mule;
Corpses rot. As we stare,
Vultures pick their bones bare.
Excarnation — the act of a ghoul.

I remember my dad seemed to be
Like a giant, much larger than me.
Now he's frail and so old,
Blanket-wrapped from the cold
And I kiss him — like when I was three.

These bees' stingers have barbs. Nope, not funny.
And, whether it's cloudy or sunny,
Tribe Apini spends hours
Getting pollen from flowers
Which is why it is hairy-eyed, honey.

Oh, ID, as a theory, you're dismal
When describing things post-cataclysmal;
Messrs. Darwin and Hubble
Can surely cause trouble
For folks with beliefs catechismal.

Though the "gaunt look" has gained popularity,
In real life, thank God, it's a rarity.
One more often observes
Winsome women with curves
Instead of severe angularity.

Adagio music should go
Quite slowly (but not largo slow!)—
The Barber is famous.
But some ignoramus
Would think it was boring, you know.

We may differ in some ways, I know,
But we're all biauricular, so
That in having two ears,
All of mankind are peers.
(Okay, maybe not Vincent van Gogh.)

Let the reign of the truth now begin.
Let it startle and break through the din.
Can the Earth bear the weight
Of our greed and our hate?
Is self-righteousness man's greatest sin?

Eaten food that's gone off?  Then I fear
That abdominal  cramps may be near.
There's not much you can do
Except—quick, find a loo,
If you find you've acute diarrhoea.

"I've got twenty-one pen-friends," she boasted.
"That's twenty-one letters just posted."
And it lights up her eyes
When she reads their replies:
Correspondence — it has to be toasted!

All the undersea divers advise
Against surfacing fast—no surprise.
But when asked to explain
Why the bends causes pain,
They will all devise divers replies.

That waiter's a traitorous meanie!
I'd expect he'd select a zucchini,
Not some damn cocozelle
To cram in my belly,
When I ordered a gourd with linguine.

"I've got a confession to make,"
Said Vanessa to Kevin. "I fake
What in truth should be strong,
And our love just feels wrong."
Poor dear Kev — now his future's at stake!

It was Thomas E. Dewey's disgrace
To run twice, but then take second place.
(And the last loss was stunning!)
Of all the men running,
He's the last one with hair on his face.

A potential political drama
Was forestalled when a speech by Obama
Was censored. The cuts
Covered two "kiss my butt"s
And, in closing, a nasty "Yo' mama!"

Both his parents had long ago died.
Then he lost his once-beautiful bride.
Now his children have passed.
Of his kin, he's the last.
Elder orphan's the term that's applied.

"Get out of the way, kids", yelled Dan,
"Dad can't see when he's backing the van:
There's a blind spot in back,
So let's stay off the track
And squeeze over as far as we can."

Here's a comment, I'll try to be terse:
'Bout your limericks?  I've never heard worse!
You're put off when I judge
That your poetry's sludge?
Guess I'll just put you down for averse.

Enthralled by Anne's beauteous curves,
The beguiler was showing his nerves.
He was there to propose
With a ring—but she knows
It's a ring for his nose he deserves.

I dress to avoid any gaffes.
My Manolos are six-and-a-halfs.
But my man-about-town
Likes to dress like a clown,
So I'm in for apparel of laughs.

The Delaware looked like the Styx,
But my barefooted army of hicks
Soon made Christmas turn Lenten
For Hessians in Trenton
In 1776.

Lots of confidence must be inherent
In the choice of custodial parent.
We are placing our trust
In one parent, so just
Be aware if behavior's aberrant.

His talent is truly emerging
In the art of depuring: expurging —
The reverse of defiling.
So right now he's smiling:
Got his cleansing degree, at my urging.

An odd anabranch leaves the main stream,
A digression in search of a theme.
There are bayous that wander,
Explore the out yonder,
And return like a dark, liquid dream.

When a bassist is called for a date,
He's excited and pleased, feeling great.
But transporting his bass
Is a different case,
Which can leave him extremely irate.

I'll be sending some sweet flags to Sue,
And I figure twelve dozen should do.
It's a sign of amour
With a fragrant allure.
Got a gal who's in calamus—ooh!

Uncle Chichimus, greatly revered,
Was a glove puppet. Chich pioneered
On Toronto TV.
But then, who could foresee
He'd be kidnapped and lost? Disappeared!

Bad Baldrick's a bold balistarius.
The objects he aims at are various.
You crossed him? Oh my!
He's a cross crossbow guy—
Hold on to your life, it's precarious.

"I have chared all my chares in the chare."
Has a meaning I'm willing to share:
Every little job's done —
I've completed each one
Of my chores in the narrow road.   There!

Of an instrument played with a mute,
An expression to show you the route
For subduing the sound
(In Italian it's found):
Con sordino — it's sounding tout cute!

'Cause they act as a mild anesthetic,
I quaff beers at a pace that's frenetic.
With each skip to the loo,
I'm reminded that, too,
They're a whiz of a strong diuretic.

Our echidnas will soon be parental
Even though they are both aplacental.
No placentas have they,
Which is odd, I would say.
In most mammals they're quite fundamental.

An excrescent six hours in each year
Means that, one year in four, must appear
A new day, called a leap,
So the seasons will keep
Well aligned with the turn of our sphere.

I complained to the clumsy detective:
"Be more careful!"  I added invective:
"You've been treading on clues
With your bulky damned shoes!"
Then he stopped—guess my rant was effective.

An imperious person, I've found,
Is likely to boss me around,
In a very brusque manner
(He's not worth a tanner!) —
For having no friends he's renowned.

To reject all the evidence strains
All credulity; still, some take pains
To discount what we know
("How's it warming? There's snow!")
About climate. Denialism reigns.

"One may pick one's best friend," I have penned,
"And may pick one's own nose" — augh! — "no end.
But what isn't suggested,
Unless so requested,
Is picking the nose of a friend."

Your works are unjustly neglected?
You don't get the praise you expected?
Let that man in the mirror—see?—
Join the conspiracy
Of silence that you have detected.

A good quarterback must have mobility,
And be able to move with agility.
If he's nimble, he may
Stay right out of the way
Of those linemen with all their hostility.

Father said, "We'll be hanging in Chad—
Better learn Dangla languages, lad."
Branch Dangla-Migama
Is loved by my mama,
While Mubi's the one for my dad.

Antiquer's a word rather odd;
You may think it means "older than God."
It's a noun:  "One who seeks
Ancient junk and antiques
In such quaint little spots as Cape Cod."

British bulldogs are odd-looking.  They
Have a face that may scare you away;
And though not very nimble,
These dogs are a symbol
Of the strength of the stalwart U.K.

When that mermaid was dating a bounder,
The mistreatment would always astound her,
But, aware that it's bad
To be dating a cad,
She has fallen, instead, for a flounder.

To feel Little Havana's true beat,
Calle Ocho's the name of the street
Where good food and great fun
Have their day in the sun
When its festival raises the heat.

"A disexercised word," Dan explained,
"Through disuse, has its meaning quite drained.
There's a paradise lost
Of such words — what a cost!
But with new use, the meaning's retrained."

"Esquivalience: No, I won't do
What I oughta." Some editors threw
In a copyright trap —
Set-in spurious crap
(Often plagiarists don't have a clue).

This cockerel? Yes, he is a game fowl,
Bred specially — a kind of half-tame fowl —
For cockfighting, banned
In our kind, caring land;
In days past, I'd have said a for-shame-fowl.

Testy poets devoting their time,
Penning odes that are less than sublime,
Find that argument's terser
When each contro-verser
Provokes disagreement in rhyme.

Corroboration is what it'll take
If I'm gonna be catchin' a break.
So your story is this:
Say to Mom it was sis,
And not me, you saw eating the cake.

Madagascar once used to use francs
For its businesses, budgets and banks.
This French-derived cash
Du peuple malgache
Should be shortened to Fmg, thanks.

Charles Darwin worked out a solution
To life and proposed "evolution".
"Rejecting creation
Leads not to damnation,"
Said Darwin, "that's my resolution."

"So, OEDILF is your hobby now, Danica?
Have you chosen a topic?  Britannica!
Keep it brief and concise.
'Book of reference'—that's nice!
But it simply does not rhyme with Channukkah."

Grumbled Craig, sadly stuck on a crag,
"As a climber, ascending's my bag.
But it's hard to descend;
And the hours that I spend
Being cragfast are really a drag."

At your coming or going, I peer
With enchantment on charms I hold dear.
Your bosom, I toast,
But what I love most
Is the view I behold from the rear.

When my mom taught me how to crochet,
'Twas the chain stitch I learned the first day.
When embroid'ry I learned,
It surprised me—it turned
Out I made it a different way.

To produce what this client's suggested,
Extra effort must now be invested;
The specification
Means fresh preparation
For custom-built items requested.

My words landed hard, with a thud.
"If you please, sir, your speech was a dud.
I'd have to be barmy
To sign with the Army
When Navy runs thick in my blood."

For each bridesmaid, a gift with a twist:
Precious Dorothy bags (hung from the wrist)
With fresh petals to strew.
But please say it's untrue
That each petal's a guy the bride's "kissed."

An assuetude shouldn't astound you;
You're used to whatever's around you.
Those inured to it less,
In distress, may profess
That you stink to high heaven, confound you!

When you hear the alarm sound, don't squeal!
The place ain't alight — 's no big deal.
It's a fire drill — a test;
You can stop and get dressed
Before fleeing — not so, were it real!

I'm caught in a difficult spot —
In the crosshairs.  A target I've got
On my back.  Threats of violence
Have spurred me to silence.
Did I see what took place?  I did not.

It's only a small operation,
A removal, a quick extirpation
Of a bodily part.
Please don't take it to heart.
Let's continue to do this castration.

Straying Ken found a doll who was older.
He was lusting for love a bit bolder.
Barbie said, "What's she got?"
Said Ken, "She is hot!
I know I'm a boy when I hold her."

A crop tree can play a big role,
Like becoming a telephone pole,
Or in some other clever
Commercial endeavor,
Like cork, used to stop up a hole.

When it comes to a knowledge of dip,
They say Cletus is smart as a whip:
"My smokeless tobaccy's
The color of khakis —
I wear 'em to soak up the drip."

A batting coach fine-tunes your swing
While he teaches the throws pitchers sling,
How to taunt, flaunt, and fuss,
Throw a fit, spit, and cuss
Plus to subtly (or not) grab your thing.

Moms extend themselves fully each day
By dispensing what's needed. Yes, they
Shower kisses, serve snacks,
Share advice and rub backs.
These kind acts make them givers, I'd say.

A DP is the sort who might say,
"From my home I've been driven away
As a war escapee."
Then again, it might be
When two guys are both out on one play.

Hackers' golf games are seldom that strong,
As our ball flights are roughly all wrong.
Thus, we're steadfast believers
In golf ball retrievers
That telescope fifty feet long.

Charolais have been cross-bred with Brahman
For a beef cattle not that uncommon:
It's Charbray, whose meat
Is a sumptuous treat—
Great to eat in a stew or with ramen.

Crack hardy: now, what can that mean?
Crack hearty: that paints the same scene.
There's misfortune, a blow;
And yet courage you show
So your face has a look that's serene.

For a wake at Our Lady of Grace,
Facetiousness seems out of place.
So I'm warning you, Honey:
Don't try to be funny.
No smirking—and keep a straight face!

After showering, some will take care
To add volume and style to their hair
With a hairbrush and blow
Dryer.  Me?  Years ago
I did; now I'm not blowing hot air.

"Adrenalectomize, sir, without doubt!"
Said my doc, somewhat drunk, with a shout.
"All your test results show
You might soon be laid low.
Those adrenal glands gotta come out!"

I am betting my bottom (last) dollar —
I am sure! —  that my wife will soon holler
And call me a dipstick.
And why? Your pink lipstick
Again left its mark on my collar.

Diehard fans dress as anime art
To mimic a character's part.
In cosplay they find
Many friends of like mind,
Taking Japanese manga to heart.

Well, your grammar needs more than a tweak,
And your spelling is, let's say, unique.
In regard to the plot,
It meanders a lot.
There's more structure in this: my critique.

This important dispatch case you'll bring
With the greatest of haste to the king.
The case holds the treaty
That makes peace complete. He
Must seal it, once signed, with his ring.

Battered child syndrome isn't amusing,
What with beatings, and burning, and bruising
Of young kids whose fat lips
Lead to hospital trips
From their guardians' serial abusing.

He's gambling! I'm filled with alarm
When I see that he's chancing his arm.
He's doubled the pot,
Betting all that he's got—
Which is me and the kids and the farm!

Coloration that serves to conceal
Is for prey-species, nearly ideal.
But too cryptic a state
Also hides from a mate,
Which for Darwin has little appeal.

Kudos, Chris Strolin, for these;
You write them with elegant ease.
We're patiently waiting,
Our breathing abating;
Meanwhile, I'm catching some zzzs.

When King David saw gorgeous Bathsheba,
He exclaimed, "She is cuter than Reba!
She's like J. Lo. Like wow!
I shall sleep with her now."
Was that sinful? Ask Rabbi Akiba.

Such focus is hard to ignore:
It's a topic your shrink might explore:
Is your writing obsession
A sign of regression—
Penning limerick lines by the score?

There are subsidies, tax breaks, and more
In that Christmas tree bill on the floor
Of the Senate.  Campaign
Contributions explain
Why they're hanging amendments galore.

There are dangerous toxins around;
Deleterious factors abound.
The environment's scary,
So humans are wary.
They'd rather not rest underground.

Let's confederate! Here is the plan:
If we all work together, we can
Overcome all the odds—
They may think themselves gods,
But we know they will bleed like a man.

Doctor Fry said, "Inside of each thigh
Lies a femur that hides from the eye.
It's a leg bone, you see,
Found between hip and knee,
And your skeleton's largest, no lie."

Coochie-coochie: a dance meant to please
Since the hips are not ever at ease.
They gyrate and grind
Till a man blows his mind—
More respectable (just) than striptease.

Don't say you were never clued in.
I told you that drinking's a sin.
"Go ahead, make my day!"
Is not what I'd say
To three cops,  with your snoot full of gin.

In a system of grading that's scaled
Using letters, all A's will be hailed.
B's are good, C's are fair
D's leave no room to spare,
While an F simply means one has failed.

When the boss said we all must eat dietingly,
The workers rebelled and yelled riotingly.
He increased their anxiety
With his haughty mock piety,
When he pledged: "You're all sacked, guys," disquietingly.

And're Länder and andere Sitten
Doktor Goethe himself once had written.
It means other nations
Provide inspirations
That we then ignore, here in Britain.

"Aha!" you exclaim in surprise
When you cannot quite credit your eyes;
It's what you might say
At some curious display
Or upon being told something wise.

Death certificates do help to pay
For the life I'm enjoying today.
Once a person's expired,
I can do what's required—
Write them off and explain them away.

There are matrices (quite recognizable)
That you'll find are diagonalizable.
Real symmetric (or skew-),
Or Hermitian will do—
Thus a basic inspection's advisable.

There's a wonderful math thing, compounding,
Which bewilders most folks:  it's confounding.
I am mystified too,
But I'm told this is true:
Growth therefrom can be truly astounding.

I study with utmost devotion
The dynamics of humans in motion,
But my biomechanics
Provokes my wife's panics.
She's jealous—a troublesome notion!

A young girl from abroad, the au pair
Comes and lives with a family to care
For the children. Mama
Gets a break, and Papa
A good chance to be human and err.

In France I once met Monsieur Jean.
(He turns apples to brandy in Caen.)
After downing a quart
Of his produce, I thought
Life in France can be très amusant.

In my search for a library book,
On the spine of each volume I look
For the small numbered call mark
That's Dewey's great hallmark;
Then I spirit the book to my nook.

A.B.E.'s an industrially rich,
Biochemical process in which
We get acetone first,
Then a butanol burst,
Up through ethanol—each has its niche.

That gentleman wearing a skirt,
With a tie and a button-down shirt...
And that miss in the tux...
Mix it up, that's the crux
Of the gender you blend and invert.

A con man named Theodore Crunk
Watched a retailer flail like a drunk.
So the business got scammed;
He was sure (or be damned)
That the biz mark was gonna be sunk.

In her office, they're docile as lambs.
There's no cursing, no "Hell"s and no "Damn"s,
And as patients depart,
They express, from the heart,
Many "Wow"s and a few "Thank you, ma'am"s.

His technique is not naturalistic:
His art's on cloud nine, expressionistic.
His artistic devotion
Can stir strong emotion;
I'd say he is "movingly mystic".

Said a fair-minded lady named Claire,
"With the kids, my attentions I'll share,
And  to treat each the same
Is the name of the game.
All my tykes I shall take to the fair."

If you're modelling a plane to be flown,
Like a glider that flies when it's thrown,
Then some balsawood should
Make it light, which is good—
In American tropics it's grown.

There's a trunk in your trunk that extends
From your heart, full of blood, then descends.
The aorta will feed
Every branch that you need—
The most heartfelt of all bosom friends!

With her targeted districts, how dare
Sarah Palin, with crosshairs, declare
"Don't retreat, but RELOAD!"
She should know this can goad
All the literal sickos out there.

My real-valued matrix is square.
Its diagonal (main one) is where
All the elements lie
That aren't zero—and why
This canonical form is so spare.

"Are you French or Canadian?" "Yes."
"Are you sober? Just making me guess?"
"I speak French but reside
Up in Canada. I'd
Tell you more if you'd like." "Maybe less."

There was once a poetical man
Whose limerick lines didn't scan.
I'll offer a sample:
He wrote, for example,
"The Empire of the Rising Sun was Japan."

Her truelove became disenamored
With the way she incessantly yammered,
With her losing her glamour,
Her fracturing grammar,
And stints in the slammer when hammered.

My site tends to crash when one clicks it.
Its software's so old I can't fix it.
The content's low rated;
It's slow and outdated.
I might as well simply deep-six it.

He's a farm boy.  He works very hard.
By four he is out in the yard.
His head's under the tap;
His eyes open — snap!
Then he labours all day and is tarred.

Lordy, look at you! My, how you've thinned, Rick.
I'm chagrined. Have you ginned? Have you sinned, Rick?
Gosh, your arms are so thin;
Are there muscles within?
Hell, it almost appears they're cylindric.

The quayside is rocky and dark,
So the captain's refusing to park.
We'll remain under way
Till the dawn of the day,
Take our breakfast, and then disembark.

My heavyweight roommate, Priscilla,
Is my pet, but she ain't no chinchilla.
Her name, scientific,
Is super-specific:
Gorilla gorilla gorilla.

A suspension of rights is conceivable.
A complete fascist state is believable.
While the mood is intense,
Call it "Homeland Defense"
And then any corruption's achievable.

"Will you book me a cab?" asks the guy.
"A taxicab, sir? I will try."
Then the guy says to me,
"And how long will it be?"
"Nearly thirteen foot six," I reply.

There's the osprey, the honey, the moor;
Then the town prefixed Leighton (obscure).
Buteo is the bird,
And buzzard's the word.
Types of falcon — they're varied, for sure.

When a lady's egg meets with a sperm,
They combine, and the outcome's a germ.
Some forty weeks later
(If still in its mater)
The fetus is classed as full-term.

We're the After Class Really Offbeat
New Youth Movement All Nude Indiscreet
Aggregation. Want in?
Simply show lots of skin
And say, "Acronymania's neat!"

Want a rather self-centered projection
Where, in each azimuthal direction,
Shortest paths appear straight?
Squash the globe like a plate;
That's your fine equidistant confection.

When Lily and Daisy and Rose
Went afield where the wildflower grows,
Did they while away hours
Whilst gathering flowers,
Or wilt in the sunshine and doze?

The old  cellar is looking divine
(Now its shelves are quite heavy with wine).
With half red and half white,
It is such a delight
Just to think that this booze is all MINE!

For each challenge, this woman is fitted,
Sailing forth with her brow deeply knitted:
Gutting fish, clearing drains,
She's true grit, not much brains!
Sets her face to the task, with teeth gritted.

Double-charged, thanks to you, and I'm burning.
I suspect that you're new, and I'm yearning
For times past and still  hope
That I'll die by the rope,
'Cause this chair is no place for your learning!

A Bantu from ancient Uganda
Had a longing to see a wild panda,
But his hot-air balloon
Blew off course (a monsoon),
All the fault of Lord Shiva in Chanda.

Something filled to the brim has a link
To a hat with a brim, I would think.
I say this because
We often find straws
In a brimmer we wear or we drink.

Are you wanting a dog (an obscure 'un,
Like President Martin Van Buren)
With fawn-colored hair
And black tips, to take care
Of your sheep? Try a Belgian Tervuren.

"We've found DHMO in the seas.
All that coffee you drank, and cooked peas,
Had dihydromonoxide!"
Then, when this news shocks, I'd
Yell, "H2O!  April Fools' tease!"

Hurtling earthwards, a meteor could
Change our lifestyle, and not for the good.
Crashing somewhere, it might
Be at best a rare sight,
Or destroy us. (Let's all knock on wood.)

Our new roomer has started a rumor
That I've got an immense fatty tumor
Down below in my gut.
I should censure her, but
"Dear, I'm pregnant," I state with good humor.

With au bout de son latin, I convey
My exhaustion and mental decay.
At the end of my wits,
I'll be calling it quits—
No more Latin declensions today.

"Have a dekko," said Jane, "a quick look,
At this wonderful limerick book.
It defines every word
That the authors had heard.
In the aeons this exercise took."

Then there's choanoid: shaped like a funnel—
Wide then small, like a very short tunnel.
Would a knife clinch your view
That this meaning is true?
You think not? Well then, maybe this gun'll.

"It's a sensitive issue," said Chris.
"As MP, I can't comment on this.
You can quiz me or fawn,
But I will not be drawn.
Just take photos — I've babies to kiss."

Seems the rock star was drunk, his words slurred,
When you have ta clap now's what she heard.
But the groupie's applause
Ended quickly because
His look told her that "the" was the word.

The cheerleader flips down the field.
All of those in her way better yield!
She cartwheels so fast
She's here, now she's past,
You can't see that her tummy's revealed!

Senior boys? They're are all gloomy and cheerless,
As it seems that the prom will be beerless.
And the girls? They cry, fearless,
"The dance will be peerless!
'Cause sober, our dates will be leerless!"

A fantabulous evening was had
By my daughters. The concert was rad!
And the singer looked cute
In his form-fitting suit. 
Now, if only his voice weren't so bad...

An Iraqi who strolled down a path
Met a kidnapper driven by wrath.
Said the latter, "You're Sunni;
I'm Shi'ite (and loony),
So I guess I'll be taking a Baath."

Patrick visits Brazil, and he sees a
Sweet lady—a lovely mestiza.
"Caboclo—is that
What I call you?" asks Pat.
She sighs, "Yes, but my real name's Teresa."

The cooing of doves signals rain,
And it's plain that the rain helps sustain
Their wild being.  With pleasure,
I listen and treasure
Their calling, a mellow refrain.

CO2 is depleting the ozone,
Or so say the folks in the know zone.
News suited for frowns,
But disputed by clowns
That are rooted in towns in the Bozone.

Canonero II: champion unique.
Won the Derby and then won the Preak-
Ness but not Belmont Stakes.
Came in fourth, them's the breaks.
A sore foot slowed this steed at his peak.

The carousel kept going round,
But my baggage was not to be found
When I got to L.A.
I learned later that day
That my luggage was Washington-bound.

I said to my grandfather, Keith,
"You're not dentulous, though you have teeth.
Because, as we've shown,
Yours were bought and not grown,
And you've nothing but gums underneath."

In Hawaii are two lava rocks:
Aa's rough and occurs as big blocks,
While pahoehoe, you'll find,
Is the smooth, ropy kind.
You should not walk across them in socks!

Crime is rampant; we cannot endure
This condition. We feel insecure.
Try proliferation —
Think regeneration —
Build cells! Build more cells! That's the cure.

My big bottom's become an expanse,
A broad surface that stifles romance.
I can't take a chance
I'll split open my pants —
Gone from salsa to waltz, or "Don't dance".

I know could not's contraction is couldn't;
Some others are I'm, can't and shouldn't.
Changing it is to it's?
Join it up, and lose bits.
(Do you think that this limerick is goodn't?)

Hello, clothes moth — come in, be my guest:
Eat your way through my fine Sunday Best.
Don't stop at one hole,
Make a hundred your goal;
I could do with a fancy string vest.

"My congregants long for a beacon,"
Said the priest to the elder archdeacon.
"In the Bronx, they all claim
That the bishop should name,
To succeed you, a young Puerto Rican."

To delay would be quite inadvisable.
We will baptize Elaine
(If need be, bring a crane),
Since it's clear she is wholly baptizable.

Schizophrenia? Is it duality?
No, it isn't a split personality,
Nor a mind split in two.
There's psychosis, it's true,
As one fails in perceiving reality.

Do you think Bryan Adams, when he
Said he'd "Run to You", meant to BC?
This heaven astounds
With its heart-stopping Sounds...
All the kids wanna Rocky, eh, B?

Watch out for my brother: he'll grill ya
Some bits of a cow that'll kill ya.
Take a shooftee at that—
Bloody loaded with fat.
(Mate, chuck us anotherie, will ya?)

I'll be soaking my denims in lye
In the sink and removing their dye.
Adding bleach to the buck
Should leave jeans that, with luck,
Look so cool they'll catch everyone's eye.

For years UK plebs have been ruled
By the toffs, landed gentry, once schooled
At the College called Eton,
Where fags all got beaten
By young future judges who fooled.

Our tree-swinging cousin's a fellow
Who's mostly mild-mannered and mellow.
Should you grab, though, a grape
From a mild, mellow ape,
He will slash you with fangs long and yellow.

I tried to stay patient and calm,
But instead I blew up like a bomb:
"Did you hear what I said?
Get your butts into bed!
Just cooperate! No more 'but Mom'!"

Make an entrance that's classy and tony—
No, not on a mule or a pony,
Or a camel or goat—
Sail right in on a boat
From the south part of Asia—a dhoney.

Most apocryphal tales aren't true,
Like some emails friends forward to you.
Full of warnings most dire,
They just rouse your ire—
Urban legends, recycled, not new.

All my gauges are acting awry.
No response to whatever I try.
Autopilot's no go,
Like the sat nav, and so
By the seat of my pants I must fly.

My friend Sven said, "When men have a yen
For Norwegian books now and again,
Knowing Bokmål will do,
As will Nynorsk—those two
Are the dominant tongues in our ken."

At the dentist's, we all know the drill:
First he picks at your teeth with great skill.
Next he finds something needing
His drill. Then proceeding,
He finally sends you a bill.

"What is citicism?" Sir, I submit
It's the manners or mien of a cit
Or a citizen. "Hey,
What does cit mean?" you say?
Let me look it up lickety-split.

Said exasperated Sue in Old Blighty,
"No, h'I don't wish to play h'Aphrodite.
My main h'aspiration
Is for your castration.
You're h'an h'idiot, Sir 'Igh h'and Mighty."

There once was a boat with a bucket,
But no one could think where they'd stuck it.
When the hull sprang a leak,
Screamed the crew in a shriek,
"We should bail!"  So, they did—toward Nantucket!

A rare illness, not quite OCD,
Has been known to afflict folks like me.
I'll be thinking of rhymes
At the oddest of times,
As when golfing, or taking a pee.

A rasher of bacon a day
Keeps the doctor away, I must say!
But my butcher is mean:
When I say, "Make it lean,"
He says, "Yes Sir, just tell me which way."

Bioharmonics is bunk.
Its inventors were peddlers of junk
Priced a thousand a pop.
The feds said they must stop.
Guess their energy fields kinda stunk?

Since it's not often worn as before,
The derby is hard to ignore:
Just a simple black hat,
Round on top and that's that—
The sort Laurel and Hardy both wore.

Noah gave all his kin his assurance
That the deluge would test their endurance.
"I have built us an ark—
And we leave before dark—
'Cause we sure can't afford flood insurance."

Cenozoic: its years total, oh,
Maybe 65 million or so.
All the creatures and plants
Now alive got their chance
To arise in this era and grow.

To choose is to make a decision—
Put another way, take a position.
A choice is what you
Have decided to do
Or the option that got your permission.

Abortigenic diseases aren't rare,
And in livestock will cause them to bear
Their young prematurely,
The answer is surely:
Use enzyme-linked assays with care.

Tying rope to an anchor, my friend?
Use the knot called a fisherman's bend.
Drop it over the side
And it won't come untied,
But remember—hold on to the end.

For the day of their fifth anniversary,
Burt's planning was careful, not cursory—
Well thought out, not in haste.
Their quadruplets were placed,
Dawn to dusk, in the local day nursery.

I'm currently writing a paper
On mimesis where simians caper:
For a source, I have tapes
Of what happens when apes
Are caught apishly aping an aper.

A downward-sloped track's a decline.
Now contrast with "I'm perfectly fine."
You are not yet declining,
But if you are dining,
It might be "I'll pass on the wine."

My eyesight is dimmish (that's dim).
The prognosis is guarded (that's grim).
It's depressing  (that's sad).
I feel hopeless (that's bad).
It has robbed me of vigor (that's vim).

Commiseration was felt by the nation,
Which issued a high commendation
From a special committee
To his family, with pity,
For their loss, and his great dedication.

"Can you cure me, Doc?  Spare no expense.
For a week, what I've dreamt makes no sense:
I'm a yurt, then a tepee.
It makes me feel creepy.
It's a nightmare." "Relax! You're two tents!"

Some bigots who visited Cannes
Demanded a gay-movie ban
And, in ads quite extensive,
They screamed, "It's offensive!"
They failed; viewers raved to a man.

An eleve (pupil or learner)
May not be a genius like Turner.
For example, at school,
I liked acting the fool—
Joked around, but of work was a spurner.

If you rhyme my home state, please feel free
To just use the short format: CT.
Easy rhymes? There are plenty—
Some nine hundred twenty,
But "Connecticut"? Tough, you'd agree.

An integral sometimes equips
Mathematicians to come fast to grips
With the length of an arc.
*(My note's not a remark
Which, without a fuss, off the tongue trips!)

When your dishes are flavored with dill,
They will never taste run-of-the-mill.
This great spice really tickles
Your palate in pickles;
With salmon, this herb fills the bill.

The noun boodle means "loot," yet I'm proud
To report one more meaning's allowed.
Though it's not often used,
And may make folks confused,
The term boodle can also mean "crowd."

There's a party at which you arrive.
If your goal, when it's done, is to strive
To return home alive,
In no circumstance drive
With a BAC more than .05!

A chump who's a frump and quite plump
Had been tricked to sit down on a stump
With a bump that was thick.
What a gullible hick!
Now he's got a sore lump on his rump.

An airheaded bimbo named Phoebe
Fell madly in love with a Soebe.
When she found he was false,
Phoebe shared a last waltz,
Then shot him to death with a boebe.

It resembles a palm tree at times
And will flourish in tropical climes
(Not Alaskan or Iowan).
I speak of the dioon.
Its name, sad to say, has few rhymes.

Unlike Zeke, who last week got a sacking,
Impressive ideas I'm not lacking.
With my pottery box,
No plates cracked.  Cracked boss Cox,
"Zack, your concept is great; truly cracking!"

He can "see" through his Marxist myopia
A Communist State cornucopia
That feeds all the masses.
Without rose-tinted glasses,
I see what he'll get: bleak dystopia.

A thing that's basipetal's going
Top downward, as water likes flowing.
Though it may seem depravity,
Or at least antigravity,
That's not how most plants do their growing.

Those expansion joints? Not a big deal:
Simply gaps between sections of steel,
Or of concrete, so planned
As to let them expand,
Not to add to aesthetic appeal.

Three old folks fast asleep in a row,
Doing nothing, with nowhere to go.
Since their number is three,
We've a hat trick, you see.
Geriatric I'd say! Ho ho ho.

Gentle clemency, mildest of weather;
Softest breeze, lightest brush of a feather;
Wispy clouds crossing high
In a luminous sky —
At our ease, you and I walk together.

Aniconism doesn't allow
You to pray in this way, or to vow.
Its primary stricture
Is "Don't use a picture."
So deep-six that gold-plated cow!

While a beast epic tends to be long,
And in verse (like a poem or song),
It's at base allegorical.
Each creature's an oracle,
Showing what's right and what's wrong

An actor is someone who acts,
And that should be the whole of the facts—
But does 'showing emotion'
Explain the devotion
Success in this calling attracts?

We all know what this means: call in sick.
Call out sick means the same: take your pick.
Who can say how such new
East Coast usages grew?
Prepositional shifts catch on quick.

Dad keeps giving you more and more chores.
Is that blood that now pours from your pores?
You've cleaned windows and doors;
Washed the floors on all fours;
He's a glutton for punishment — yours.

Dentalism: noun, obsolete.
Definition: "dentality." Neat.
What is that? "Dental quality."
Stop this frivolity!
Tell me its meaning tout de suite.

She lay on the sheets and said sensually,
"Come talk to me sexy in French, Uli."
Such a talented man—
He's a tongue with a tan:
Accomplished in bed and accentually.

Is carphology hard to define?
Of high fever it's surely a sign.
When the patient maltreats
All his blankets and sheets,
Then the doctors give up and resign.

"Rest assured that my word is my bond.
You can trust if you call, I'll respond,"
Said the lawyer whose fee
Was prepaid (yes, by me).
Now I've learned a new word: It's abscond.

In my book, there's a list, alphabetical,
Of the drugs I have found are emetical.
Any one of the bunch
Makes me throw up my lunch,
And I've tried them—it's not theoretical.

"This fragrant West Indian plant
Called day jessamine's sweet!" cried my aunt.
"If you sniff its white flowers,
Try just daylight hours.
Can you smell it at night? No, you can't!"

His promotion is making no sense
Since your qualification's immense.
Now you feel discombobulated
(He'll be getting the job you rated)—
You're confuzzled and stunned by events.

To look like the great Halle Berry
Would make any movie star merry—
She's gorgeous, you see.
Wish her face was on me!
But my looks are commonplace—very.

Head honcho am I, it feels great.
Though, to helpers I cannot relate.
I'm chief cook, that's not bad;
But, in truth, I should add:
And bottle washer too — that I hate.

So ably and nimbly and sprightly,
Their billowy gowns spinning slightly,
Silhouettes deftly twirl,
Pirouetting awhirl;
Slender shadows, they swirl, oh so lightly.

I resolved my old image I'd scotch
With a makeover, carve a new notch.
So silk Y-fronts I wore
But I got rather sore:
The elastic was chafing my crotch.

A wager made Phileas turn
From the fog and the gaslight to burn
A trail 'Round the World
In Eighty Days, hurled
By the narrative powers of Verne.

Joe was told his blind date was AA:
"So she drinks a bit. So? That's okay."
When the girl turned up clean,
With no chest to be seen,
He discerned his mistake right away.

A dol is a measure of pain.
Level 1? Hardly cause to complain.
2, 3, 4? They're a snore.
But a 10? That's much more:
Fiery needles shoved deep in your brain.

On the Farne Isles a steam ship was wrecked
In a storm of tempestuous effect.
Grace Darling rowed out
In the gale's angry shout
To save lives, earning England's respect.

God a code virus bloggig by doze,
Ad by 'puter's god dutz. I subboze
Dat a virus idfected
Ids code. I'b dejected.
Wud virus is bad. Doo just blows.

I belonged to a group that was choral.
Discordful, we'd frequently quarrel.
At issue? My voice.
Seems they couldn't rejoice
In God's praise hearing sounds deemed immoral.

What has finitude?  Something that's bounded,
Like a fortress enclosed and surrounded.
But my love for you, dear,
Isn't finite, that's clear;
It keeps growing like interest compounded.

On the floor, by that senator's chair,
My contraption gets many a stare.
You ask why? I say, "Well,
Anemometry'd tell
Just how fast was these speakers' hot air!"

This mythical hellhole ain't pretty;
It's lawless; it's gruff, grim and gritty.
Every buckaroo knows
It's where anything goes —
You can do what you want in Dodge City.

While out bowling, Bob whispered to Faye:
"It's my wish that we go all the way."
She replied, "There's no doubt
I agree." Both struck out.
Only Faye, though, got lucky that day.

Said Aunt Mindy, ashamed and chagrinned,
When she (how shall I say it?) broke wind,
In the church, in a session
Of holy confession:
"Don't get downwind of me, as I've sinned."

Ending prejudice—that's the group's aim.
"Don't be bigots!" its members exclaim.
What's the bias they face?
Not their age, faith or race—
Anti-mustache behavior's to blame.

There are times when a fighter must cede.
Please, surrender. You no longer need
To remain in the field,
To defy and not yield.
Just lie down for a breather and bleed.

This morning our stock prices broke
When our company chairman misspoke.
He'd intended to say:
"I drank soda all day."
What he said: "I'm addicted to Coke."

Once unknown within history's pages
Was the period called the Dark Ages.
Petrarch claimed he could mark
The years bounding this Dark,
But his Dark mark was ruled out by sages.

An extraterrestrial guest
Came wandering in from the west.
With an almond-eyed gaze,
It appeared through the haze
And said: "Mulder, you're under arrest!"

How much compound's dissolved?  Don't just guess it:
Colorimetry helps to address it.
When you measure O.D.
At some wavelength, you see,
That absorbance will let you assess it.

One look at a freshly made bagel
May thoughts of mad munching inveigle.
Its origins? Mystery!
Who wrote beygl's history,
Or maybe some facts did finagle?

"For my chowder, there's nothing impedible:
These oysters are [censored] incredible!
Leave no praises unvoiced —
They are succulent, moist ..."
"Blecch. They're just barely esculent (edible)."

It's a cognitive kind of devotion:
A concept, idea, or notion.
I'm in love with the thought
Of this guy, while I ought
To adore him, what's more, with emotion.

Balclutha? It's south from Dunedin.
To leave Invercargill, you're needin'
To head mostly east,
To the Clutha, at least
(Where the road from Dunedin was leadin').

Holding rallies in every red state again,
Trump demands, "Make America Great Again!"
He means grand?  That's absurd!
I'd say hate's the right word —
He is making America hate again.

Tracking trends, we lay bare the concealed,
And through language our culture's revealed.
Terms may flourish and spread;
Others quickly drop dead:
Culturomics, a word-counting field.

Our draftsperson, known here as Tex,
Draws up plans and develops the specs
When we build a new house,
While his draftswoman spouse
Checks, corrects, and supplies him with sex.

When you boil what is left of your beer,
Trap the vapour and dump it (no fear:
That's just water). Then chilled,
You will find that, distilled,
The result will infuse you with cheer.

Slowly passing a truck, long and big,
The young driver looked out, and yelled "Pig!"
As my head spun around
There's a thud-and-squeal sound —
As I creamed the damn pig with my rig.

With your words you should practise economy
If you'd criticise my physiognomy.
All my forebears were vain,
Also rich and insane,
So to kill you won't strain my cleronomy.

In producing his movie romances,
My friend doesn't take any chances.
He plans to make Salma
(Ms Hayek) the alma:
The girl who's from Egypt and dances.

Corporations' emissions unclean?
Ecoterrorists find this obscene,
So they punish the cruel
With destruction. (But who'll
Go make sure their explosives are green?)

Day laborers, when they are able,
Do casual work — it's not stable.
They work by the day,
And often their pay
Is quite low and paid under the table.

When I think of cosmetics in use,
I consider the toxic ceruse,
Better known as white lead.
If it's used on your head,
It's like putting your neck in a noose.

The absolute monarch decreed:
"Every law must conform to my need!
I will let it be known
You can't challenge the throne!"
—Making democrats angry indeed.

You'd conditionate marriage with me?
A prenuptial agreement I'd see
As a sign of no trust —
Now our plans are a bust:
That's a bond to which I'll not agree.

As he slathered his pancakes ambitiously,
His siblings addressed him suspiciously:
"That Log Cabin's for all!"
"But my flapjacks are small."
Unobserved, Tom still poured surreptitiously.

Saw an ad for a tooth plaque curtailer —
A professional, sharp, dental scaler.
Its name? "Easy Pickins!"
I bit. What the dickens!
Tooth scaler? No way — gum impaler!

Your front and rear lawns are immense,
Yet you've circled them.  Sure, this tall fence
Of barbed wire round the yard
Means intruders are barred,
But it's hard to defend the expense.

To the charming, discreet bourgeoisie
(Middle-class as a glass of chablis),
The "means of production"
Is just a construction
To rankle the powers that be.

On a test for biology writers
Was: "Who's Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters?"
That he'd studied the brain,
I recalled without strain—
Without cramming or pulling all-nighters.

From your very first day here on Earth,
Let's be honest: there's disparate worth.
Some are born to great wealth,
Some to delicate health.
It's a crapshoot, this thing we call birth.

I'm a humourless prig.  I detect
Heinous thought crimes all round.  I suspect
Every innocent word.
I'm a nerd.  I'm absurd.
But, politically, am I correct!

"When I die, all my heirs can relax;
My estate won't be taxed to the max.
What? The death tax? A joke,
When your uncle dies broke."
The will's signature? That's Uncle Jack's!

This chump who loved women would dine 'em,
But his fare would quite soon disincline 'em:
The food was too old,
Enshrouded with mold,
And full of — oh gross! — botulinum.

Gender bias in language? Absurd!
Mankind needs no such asinine word.
One must laugh when he sees
Girlish nonsense like these
Most hysterical claims that he's heard.

Man connaturally hungers for food.
From the time that we're born, it's pursued.
Though my body does need it,
The loads that I feed it
Have made my poor belly protrude.

It's bionics that breeders were keen
To employ on the husbandry scene.
When a zebu was bred
To an aurochs, it led
To the very first zerochs machine.

A martyr to bold eccentricity,
He believed he could use electricity
To put some more life
Into sex with his wife. . .
Their grave is of tasteful simplicity.

There's no reason that we need to warn a
Motorist that we have drawn a
Clamp down on speeders,
(Get cash from the bleeders!)
With cameras on every street corner.

He thinks that he'll study bryology,
A moss-centered branch of biology:
But by rolling some grass,
He gets stoned before class,
So he gathers no moss terminology.

When our ancestors felt the vibration
Of the earth—its abrupt agitation—
Cavemen cringed and were scared;
They were never prepared
For an earthquake—the ground's concussation.

Skeins of Canada geese write aversively.
They form block-letter vees by dispersively
Taking turns:  the geese aer-
odynamically share.
Skeins of snow geese form their flight vees cursively.

A poison that acts on the nerve,
Aconitine crystals will serve
To examine, in part,
An arrhythmical heart,
But do not put them in an hors d'oeuvre.

"Dagbani is spoken in Ghana,"
Said my know-it-all aunt from Botswana.
"Its linguistic group's Gur.
Now I hope you'll make sure
To remember these facts." (I don't wanna.)

British English? For some it has class
When a girl's not a chick, but alas,
She's a lass, or a bird,
And I also have heard
They burn petrol in place of our gas.

William's "at 'em ball" worked all day long,
Though his arm's not especially strong.
Here's the rundown on Bill:
"Long on luck—short on skill."
"We don't care!" say the worshiping throng.

Church services messed with her head:
Too long, and too boringly led.
Three years old, indiscreet,
And with young itchy feet,
"Shall we make this the last hymn?" she said.

To a black mass  — that's where I have been:
I had hoped to see something obscene.
It was held in the night
And without any light,
So a mass of black's all that I've seen.

Mr. Fogg takes a circular way
'Round the world, but he has a delay.
Still, the bet he's not losing—
The dates are confusing.
It still is the eightieth day!

Two biblical kings Ahaziah,
In Israel and Judah none higher:
One fell through the ceiling,
And the other's mean dealing
Made him just like his mom, Athaliah.

Biographically challenged from birth,
I can tell what my life-story's worth.
Though it might appear cuter
If told à la Pooter,
Of page-turning smut there's a dearth.

A cobbler should stick to his last
Where his errors are all in the past.
What lays people low
Are the things they don't know,
And what they don't know shows up fast.

If I write some new lyrics, you'll knock
Out some musical notes on your glock,
So our talents, combined,
Mean, together, we'll find
Our collaborative effort will rock!

On the dance floor I bop to the beat.
I whirl and I swirl something sweet.
I'm a cool girly bopper,
No clumsy clodhopper
Who rocks on his own two left feet.

Consider the sloth with two toes:
Didactyl, and slow when he goes
Climbing headfirst down trees
(Upside down, if you please);
So slothful a trip, he may doze.

As the driver adjusted his glove
Of berlin, there was each turtledove
Cuddling tight for the ride.
In his carriage they'll glide
Through Berlin by berlin—so in love!

There's another deserving of blame
For divulging a CIA name,
But I sit in this cell
For refusing to tell
Who told me about Valerie Plame.

"Your heart-sounds are playing odd tricks;
They add whoosh to each beat, just for kicks."
(As my doc, with a frown,
Put his stethoscope down)
"Your bicuspid I'm fixin' to fix!"

When in life's daily fight you contrive
To eat someone's lunch, you deprive
Him of profit, success—
Make him come out with less.
It's just one of the ways that we strive.

Thomas Allen's career has been long,
On the opera stage and in song.
His diction's exacting,
He's expert at acting,
And his voice is both agile and strong.

I remember the taste of the beer,
And her smell when I nibbled her ear,
And that sight, her behind
(Where my touch was declined).
What a pity my hearing's so clear.

TV's better than ever?  A fable!
If that's so, tell me why I'm unable
To find squat on TV
Despite three hundred three
Individual channels on cable!

Fern was flabby last fall at the Hyatt.
She won't exercise, never will diet;
Yet she's slim now—it's drastic.
Was it surgery, plastic?
This shape—just how did Fern come by it?

Adlubescence? There's plenty about,
Though not called that: the term's faded out.
Still, that swelling of heart,
That sheer joy off the chart,
Perseveres — was there ever a doubt?

Here's a story of twins. It is said
That they dressed like a horse to earn bread.
When they had to decide
On their roles, one replied
Without thought, "I'm an ass; you're ahead."

Look out for the enemy. Doubt
Every man and his dog. Send a scout
Up ahead without fail.
Also, watch your own tail
For faux friends (foes within). Root them out!

Ad absurdum I'll quickly reduce
Your hypothesis, pal — here's the noose:
If your theory is right
Then the day and the night
Are concurrent. You see — it's obtuse!

If your silhouette makes you feel blue,
And your thighs look like mush, here's a clue:
There's no need to feel blah,
Just come out to my spa.
Anticellulite treatment's for you!

Raw data is tricky, indeed,
Since it's not very easy to read.
But the end of this plight,
After all, is in sight.
Data processors: that's what I need.

"I was dumbstrucked my true love forsooked me,
I can't tell you how much that it shooked me."
"How long has it taked
To shake being forsaked?"
"I can't tell you how long that it tooked me."

For controverse seems we are headed,
If to utter deceit you are wedded.
Though her fur's a bit long,
Pooh a thoroughbred? Wrong!
And her papers? You say they've been shredded?

With an e-ticket, purchased on line,
Stress-free booking is simple, and mine.
Without leaving the house,
At the click of my mouse,
I'm enjoying this new chance to shine!

In the trenches I'll never forget
How we watched for the Hun's silhouette:
By incendiary glare
And occasional flare,
Adumbration revealing the threat.

If it's classified stock that you bought,
Please consider which type you have got.
If your shares are marked "A,"
You get voting rights. Yay!
If they're "B," I'm afraid you do not.

I love you who are waisted. Here's why:
I am hoping my belts you will buy.
Deep-waisted, or fair-,
Short- or long-, I don't care,
"Always keep your waist belted!" say I.

To crush 'til it's wrinkled is crumple.
To make the sheets wrinkled is rumple.
But who would have thought
(Because novel it's not)
That to fold, perhaps wrinkle, is dumple?

Look up "duck" on the calorie chart;
If you eat it, please take it apart!
First remove all the fat
And the skin. After that,
It perhaps will not damage your heart.

An asthmatic young man, named Ali,
Began wooing a pert divorcée.
Having heard Ali wheezing
While hugging and squeezing,
She asked, "You're allergic to me?"

Our fort fell, and we knew we'd been wrong:
We had held back our fire for too long.
The encounter was mortifying!
Our new leadership, fortifying,
Makes sure our defenses are strong.

Hey there, broom squire, make me a broom!
Make it small since I don't have much room.
Selling whisk brooms like mad,
You undoubtedly add
To the global broom boom, I assume.

When I pause to consider my brain,
Paradoxically that puts a strain
On the brain that I pause to
Consider, because to
Consider things causes it pain.

A modern monastic has sunk
Into monkeyshines, mischief, and bunk.
He's a cenobite biting
The hand underwriting
His life—what a devilish monk!

The great Lewis and Clark expedition
Noted flowers as part of its mission.
Evening primrose became
Genus Clarkia:  fame,
But, in modern days, scant recognition.

Akola was where I had gotten
This Indian cloth of fine cotton.
Looks great on the bed,
Or as curtains instead;
But in trouser form, man, it looks rotten.

Romney thinks his past views are erasable—
Like an Etch A Sketch picture: replaceable.
He hopes voters ignore
What he championed before
But, with video, such things are traceable.

To his harem at noon crooned the swami,
"For our lunch we'll have rye and pastrami,
Then recline for a rest,
At which time I'll suggest:
Hold the onions and hide the salami."

For the player of jai alai, siesta
Delivers a much-needed rest—a
Hiatus from all
Of that throwing the ball
With his narrow curved basket: the cesta.

Look at me — on the skids, rocks and dole!
Please, sir, alms? Just two bucks is my goal.
Nearly all that I've got,
Sir's, my begging bowl pot.
I'm a what? That is rot!  Damn your soul!

When studying music, as reader
Of Bach, I rely on my Schmieder,
But for art songs, I find,
I must leave Bach behind,
And let Schubert become my new lieder.

On Anguilla I loaf in the sun;
Might snorkel or go for a run.
Or not—what's the rush?
'Sides, this beachhouse is plush
And this pineapple daiquiri? Fun!

Who has starred as a middle-aged girl?
Well there's Carol and Barbara—and Pearl.
(In a cast that was black.)
Dolly got Horace back
After banning the cad: "You're a churl!"

He's a male offspring seen from one other
Of the children both born from one mother.
This guy or this maid
Now might call him for aid:
"You must help me, you know, you're my brother!"

"Come with," says my daughter-in-law
To my grandson, who sticks out his paw,
Which she takes in her hand
And starts off, as I stand
In the door and he waves at me (…aww).

In the bathtub, I don't need to grope:
I use echo and soundings, and hope
That the pulse-timing shows
Any wrecks, and then goes
On to pinpoint my slippery soap.

Near the Black Sea, a tourist cried, "Eew!
Why, this river smells worse than a loo.
Johann Strauss notwithstanding,
It's truth I'm demanding.
The Danube is brownish—not blue!"

What does davenport mean?  Sofa bed.
Or it could be a small desk instead.
Or an Iowa town
That has gained some renown
As the place Cary Grant became dead.

In the wake of the blast underground,
They went looking for gas tanks unsound.
But the tanks weren't fat —
They were empty and flat:
'Twas acetylene tanks that they found.

Ennobled am I, this fine day.
Made a nobleman: cheers and hooray!
I say damn the humility —
Now I'm nobility,
Bow as you're backing away.

In this moth family, one special genus
I seek with devotion and keenness.
I'll surely feel high a day
That I meet with Arctiidae:
Empyreuma, as lovely as Venus.

A gourmet is a person who's fond
Of outstanding food. I go beyond
And continue to eat
Past the point I'm replete.
I'm not simply gourmet, but gourmand.

My girl's father's a guy she calls Dad,
So a dad-in-law I could have had,
If the bloke hadn't told me
He was eager to scold me,
So the marriage was blown. Just too bad!

Direct-dial your long-distance call;
There's no contact with humans at all.
No more cryptic translations
To phone your relations
In Rabat, 	Culiacán or St. Paul.

If carnation ("the color of flesh")
Is a pink, I'm afraid that won't mesh
With complexions one sees
In Morocco, Belize,
Or Taiwan, let alone Bangladesh.

My decision I see as historic:
I'm giving up food that's caloric.
The health-zealots' choir
Dispatched my desire —
I listen to pleading that's choric.

I degerm all my gear to defeat germ-
caused illness. I'm sure that I beat germ-
caused woe, and I know,
If it's wheat that I grow,
By degerming the grain, I'll get wheat germ!

Let me cradle my son once again;
Let me hold him and rock him, and then
Take him home, if You must.
Unto dust I entrust
His remains, just a month short of ten.

With iron, they taught me that sin
Burrows deeper than scars on my skin.
That singe-mark will last
And will dredge up the past:
I'm branded, without and within.

Yes, the book rests on my metacarpals,
But the finger that points is Miss Marple's.
While my noggin collects
Scattered facts, she connects
All the clues that her author desparples.

Since the Swiss favor holes in their cheese,
As their host I'll be aiming to please
With some soft, ripened kinds
Of fromage that have rinds.
Here's a gun—let's start shooting the Bries.

A cinnamon bear scared some nurses
When she sniffed at their backpacks and purses.
But the sow backed off quickly
And stared, looking sickly:
The bear heard her bearherd yell "Ursus!"

Stop tapping your feet; it's annoying—
Those are waxed hardwood floors you're destroying.
Take this as a pointer—
It's a nuisance to clointer
With those ironclad shoes you're deploying.

Queen Cleo was bathing, and said,
"This milk smells like warm almond bread,
And if I can't source
Milk from ass, cow or horse,
Then amygdalate's perfect instead."

He lifted his head at my whistle,
Then darted away like a missile.
He was chasing a cat
With his ears laid back flat;
Every hair on his neck was abristle.

Aminoaciduria? Jeez!
This condition's a pain, if you please.
Seems I'm pissing away
So much acid all day
I'm just basically minding my pees.

Mix ketchup and Coke in a cup;
Let chicken or ribs soak it up.
This cheap barbecue sauce
Makes the food purists cross,
But it's yummy — come over and sup!

Did nature correctly equip us
To deal with the Drypis, or gyp us?
It's a genus of herb
That we'd best not disturb,
As its sharp, spiny leaves may, well, nip us.

Though I should have my Pinto restored,
I am posting, instead, a reward:
Help me put in the slammer
The jerk with a hammer
Who bashed my now banged-up old Ford.

They call it a garter snake? Why?
Garters aren't made for me—I'm a guy—
But if I were a dame,
I'd ignore that dumb name.
That's the last thing I'd wrap 'round my thigh.

"Our friend Poppo is pope!" Friends would shout it
On hearing the good news about it.
Back in 1048,
Did he win with the great
Slogan: "Poppo for Pope-o"? I doubt it.

Total cloudlessness reigns in a sky
Clear and black, with the moon riding high.
Winter stars before dawn
Glitter brightly. They're gone,
As the sun applies tender blue dye.

Coxiella, bacterial genus,
Is ravaging cows from Salinas.
It's hit all the stocks
Of our cattle (not cocks)
And has nothing to do with the penis.

You are off on a trip to Bhutan.
To be well understood, if you can,
You will need to learn Dzongkha—
It's  easy to conquer.
And then you can talk man to man.

A baseball is typically found
In the air and not down on the ground.
It's white with red stitches,
The object of pitches;
That thwack is a marvelous sound!

Your anatomy texts would construe
That your "axis" is vertebra two.
Things called "axoid" pertain
To this bone, and remain
Quite a pain in the neck to review!

She's cheerless and chilly. Behold
How she'll scathingly, snappily scold.
She's distant, disdainful —
Finds friendliness painful.
She's frigid and frosty. She's cold.

The consultant's demeanor was gentle.
She knew of my fears, incremental,
Of the sound of my heart;
So she looked through my chart,
Said, "Your murmur, Ms. Blume? Accidental."

The scientist labored, unknownly,
To copy himself, working clone-ly.
He was hidden away,
But he dreamt every day
Of a prize from Nobel, his alonely.

I once was an intern, in training
As a medic, lived in; it was draining.
Internship complete,
Now an extern. How sweet!
I live out. You won't hear me complaining.

To describe a dynamical system
You must learn complex maths. Don't resist 'em
If you wish to embrace
How in time and in space
A point moves. Study now if you missed 'em.

Most conspire to acquire and retire.
Some aspire to inspire and expire.
A few I admire
Live alert and afire
With desire to perspire and enquire.

Talking smooth, looking trim, nipped and tucked,
Fielding questions (the tough ones he's ducked),
Till one evening, when he
Right on prime-time TV
Drops the F-bomb. Man, auto-destruct!

Scotland's brutal, enforced Highland Clearances
Led to cultural loss, disappearances:
Humans ousted for sheep
(Still, the landlords could sleep).
For the poor, life's about perseverances.

Said my wife, with her eyes scrunched up tight,
 "That flash is so blindingly bright!"
 Said I nervously, "Uh,
 Is it safe to say 'duh'"?
 "Yes, but then you'll get nothing tonight."

It's for those who lack all gardening skill.
It cares not if it's warm or it's chill.
It'll grow in full shade
In a house or a glade.
Aspidistra—the plant you can't kill.

A beer garden snack sure to please,
Often partnered with pretzels, one sees.
It's made in that area
Known as Bavaria—
Allgauer Emmentaler cheese!

Lord Sidcup at last passed away,
But his relatives found, with dismay,
That he'd left every pound
To his smelly old hound—
Well, it's said "every dog has its day".

In the bathroom I had to remain,
'Cause I suffered abdominal pain.
Thirty minutes or more
I was in there.  What for?
Backdoor trots — I was letting it drain.

Hawaii-bound Jessica Schneider
Was enjoying a hot mug of cider.
I advised her, "Beware
Of Chiracanthium there.
It's a genus of venomous spider."

Once a baby-maker, maker of dollies,
Jack went broke; it was one of his follies.
But that skill turned out handy:
He married Chef Brandi —
They beget baby candy (doll lollies).

L'chaim! Mazel tov! Girl, you're it!
You're now a bath mitzvah, legit.
You chanted the Torah
And now, kenahorah,
For adulthood you're finally fit!

You've been working long hours for your pay,
But 'the Seagulls' are playing away;
Now you've plotted a scheme
To go follow your team.
You'll be grabbing a nice duvet day.

Puzzled readers react with hostility,
And accuse you of growing senility,
Claiming words of your ode
Have been written in code,
Wholly lacking decipherability.

The long tube in my chemistry set,
With the measure marks?  That's my burette.
Turn the tap to and fro
And it varies the flow
Of the poison I'm planning you'll get!

Seeing life through the startle-prone eyes
Of autism, she could apprise
Us of stress palliation
Through sage angustation,
From squeeze chutes to self. Grandin's wise.

I experience your feelings, I do;
We are on the same page, me and you.
I'm in tune, empathetic,
And waxing poetic —
We fit like a foot in a shoe.

Astrotherapy looks to the stars
To help heal psychological scars.
If you envy your brother
Or lust for your mother,
Seek answers in Jung and in Mars.

With the meeting of eyes, and that gaze,
The game started. So much would amaze
In this sudden encounter;
Preparing to mount her,
His snooker cue scored through the baize.

For hors d'oeuvres I've an appetite hearty,
But I'm never invited to party.
I guess they can't dig my
Loud gas — borborygmi.
Too bad that's the life of the farty.

He was innocent, Blago pretended,
When his Illinois tenure was ended
For soliciting bribes.
Local custom proscribes
Being caught in the act—deprehended.

When the airframe develops the shakes
From the buffeting turbulence makes,
Every passenger there
Prays the passenger's prayer:
"God, I hope there weren't any mistakes!"

On the oyster farms, boats can be found
That are flat-bottomed. Flush on the ground
They can "sit" at low tide,
While thereafter they glide,
When the tide has returned safe and sound.

In the corpus allatum (a gland
That makes juvenile hormones), it's planned
That a larva will stay
Immature to the day
When the insect is ready to stand.

Here is boffo, a word I wrote down,
That resembles the name of a clown.
Something's boffo if it
Is a laugh or a hit.
It's an adjective; also a noun.

In a crystal, light's speed is contingent
On whether the stuff's birefringent.
A ray's interactions
With double refractions
Make two, when just one was impingent.

High achievement's not yours for the touch,
And you won't be accomplishing much
If you give in to doubt.
It, for sure, will win out.
Accepting such fate is a crutch.

A reporter, I cover divorce courts.
My impression at first: change-of-course courts,
But the looks on the faces
Of the folks in most cases
Makes me now call  the places remorse courts.

Fair Miss Claire stopped her baldness-denying
When wind sent her blonde wig a-flying.
Her hair was proved threadbare
When air left her head bare;
To fans — and to me — she'd been lying.

Though court-martialed, you'd never have guessed
That I'm serious and scared. Court recessed
To let me calm down,
But I laugh like a clown.
See, I get the damn giggles when stressed.

She is calm; he's the merrier type,
A butch pit-bull-terrier type.
She is weak, plays with kittens,
Knits soft woollen mittens;
Each a pure gender stereotype.

So you think that your wallet is fat?
Try the Amex 'cause that's where it's at!
Hot tips on cold stock —
Pretty soon you're in hock.
You can't get more American than that.

Human fetuses, shrewdly well versed,
Form the gut, with the anus made first.
And, while still within mater,
The mouth is made later:
We're deuterostomes, fully rehearsed.

In a screenplay: Engore the guy's bed—
Make it sanguine—he's meant to be dead
Would have bloody good zing
If they'd use the real thing,
But they tamely squirt ketchup instead.

Use this tool to help stir up the soil
And to aerate without too much toil.
Not for harrowing now,
Nor as deep as a plough,
It was horse-drawn before we used oil.

Calcospherite: I'd like to ask "Whazzit?"
But biologists ask "What can cause it?"
Thin calcium shells
On the tissue of cells —
Small orbs in an organ deposit.

Big bad Bluto was Popeye's buffoon.
They would battle throughout each cartoon.
Each loved Olive (Ms Oyl).
Her charms made their blood boil.
With her Swee'Pea, she'd watch them and swoon.

There's a bike that my nephew admires.
In the shops it attracts many buyers.
It is very well made,
Its design is top grade,
And it rides on select black wall tires.

I found myself being attacked:
"Good ideas must have basis in fact!"
The empiricist's sneer
Made it perfectly clear
What my theory actually lacked.

Many years ago, northerly Britain
Became Alba (or so it is written).
It's called Scotland today,
Where we love the "Wha Hae"
And we're famously dour and hard-bitten.

I like my food plain, nothing flash.
That foreign muck's nothing but trash.
Forget pasta and rice
And leave out the spice.
Just give me my bangers and mash.

I spotted my first one this week—
A black woodpecker, hefty of beak.
It may look like they are,
But they're not a red car:
They're a species, distinct and unique.

Cherry pickers skim only the best
Off a business, discard all the rest;
They don't recognise people.
The profits they reap'll
Reward the "largesse" they invest.

A threat to your sexual delight is
The condition called deferentitis;
If the tube for your sperm
Gets inflamed by a germ,
Ooh! How painful your honeymoon night is!

Are alien abductions a lie?
Bug-eyed monsters steal people and fly?
I don't think that they're real;
It's too crazy a deal.
Oh no, wait!  They just grabbed me.  Goodbye!

Was it due to its dryness (like hay)
Or its camouflage colour (mid-grey)?
Either way, now my hair
Is a tree squirrel's lair.
By my students I'm called "Dr. Drey".

Aminonaphthol: a word I've contrived
To define. Son, my nerve's been revived!
It's a compound, Bambino,
(Isomeric, amino),
And from naphthol the stuff is derived.

I'm your lawyer, and I'm not amused—
Your complexedness leaves me confused.
Now please say it again,
Using words of my ken,
Or from this case I will be excused.

Top left of the board there's a key
That's marked "Esc" for "escape", and I see
That it mostly means "Chop
This activity — stop!"
It's not there to suggest that you flee.

So the active crust boundary teems
With hot rock; it's apart at the seams!
When two crusty plates
Move around, dire straits!
They adjust; while the core below gleams.

A printer of intricate data
Found flaws in her latest errata.
But 'twas hard to detect
What had caused that effect,
When that causatrix caused her causata.

An allowable business loss can
Be deducted from tax; that's my plan.
I told my sec, Ada,
"Look, I'm not an evader—
It's legit if I write off my van."

A visiting art connoisseur
Took the gallery's organized tour.
His group was misguided—
The conduct provided?
A pimple-faced bubblegum chewer.

An encumbrance will make your step falter:
A troublesome burden, a halter
Of progress with ease,
Like a chain round your knees.
(Call it cumbrance, it ain't gonna alter.)

Prudent persons, it's said, take due care,
		But if reckless, the law says they err.
		Liability comes
		With remarkable sums
		Which all pray that another shall bear.

Jack was scared when he went to Jane's dorm,
For fear that he'd fail to perform.
His concern was in vain;
He and hot-to-trot Jane
Spent the night making love up a storm.

I grew ill while proposing to Julie;
She laughed at my plight quite unduly.
She said no and then split
With the diamond. Yes, it
Was a chapter of accidents, truly!

U2's singer's been pleading the case
For a lot of world causes. The pace
Of world aid has been speeded
And nations have heeded
His voice and his heart full of grace.

In olden-time radio shows,
The narrator asks us, "Who knows
What evil there lurks
In the hearts of some jerks?"
Well, a cardiognost, you'd suppose.

Your car's foot brake is usually used
To slow down—but it can be abused.
With your left foot press lightly
To turn in more tightly,
While your right's on the gas—be amused!

I'm in love with Lucinda's left earlobe.
It's so soft—not at all an austere lobe.
I find it endearing;
There she wears a gold earring,
So it's punctured. I feel for this dear lobe.

That new foreman we got is a punk.
Every day now I leave in a funk.
So when beer o'clock's near
(That means "quittin' time" here!),
I can't wait to go out and get drunk.

"In my marriage all's fairness, and so
We equalize chores." "How's that go?"
"Well, the downstairs I straighten,
Leave the upstairs for Leighton."
"You've a one-storey home." "This I know."

A defenceman who played as a Leaf,
Bill Barilko's career was quite brief:
Shot the puck, lit the lamp
As a Stanley Cup champ,
But his mission for fishin' caused grief.

The knights had such cumbersome armor
To shield them from harm and the harmer.
The metal was hot,
So they sweated a lot,
But it made for a great-looking charmer!

Oh, give me a chicken leg dish.
It's nicer than red meat or fish.
Then, just leave me alone,
To eat down to the bone,
Though it's useless for making a wish.

When it comes to an interest rate,
The compounding fringe benefit's great:
If percent earned is nine,
You'll be doing just fine —
Doubled dough at the end of year eight.

There's a theater that poultry endorse
Showing "Heloise: Peter's Remorse."
All the tickets aren't cheap,
But the roosters won't peep,
Since the capons get cast rates, of course.

It's a town in Nebraska, and he
Starred as Hawkeye in M*A*S*H on TV.
Here's a third and last hint:
This girl sang for a stint.
The name Alda applies to all three.

"In quinine, sort pandas neglected
Egyptian rotund undetected?
Forsooth!  Elbow batter
In ivory fatter."
(Allolalia:  speech disconnected.)

"There's a bomb in the back of your bus!"
There was nothing at all to discuss.
Though the caller had lied,
We were all soon outside,
Since the threat was sufficient for us.

At first, I just sound out a tweet.
But suddenly, after the beat,
I drop to another,
Less strong than the other.
Appoggiatura, how neat!

'Twas a buzz saw the villain named Howe
Meant to use on the poor damsel—ow.
Angry blade all awhirl—
Who would rescue this girl?
Too late! She's my half sister now.

The BC is a church of great piety,
Called "Tunkers" in old-time society,
With Wesleyan roots
And peaceful pursuits.
They are models of Christian propriety.

Let the proles (not the pigs) get their share?
In Newspeak, that's thoughtcrime, you'll swear.
(From the pen of George Orwell.
I could say much more, well —
I'll say he was born Eric Blair.)

Though it's heavy, and yellow, and cool,
There's no riches 'round here, as a rule.
I don't mean to be mean,
But the streak is dark green:
Chalcopyrite is gold for a fool.

His hands were raised over his head
As he shouted, "Don't shoot!" it was said.
Witness statements in court
Made that story fall short
(Not before the false narrative spread).

Monkey puzzle trees grew all around,
He remembers, that parcel of ground;
At the thought of those Chile pines,
Years after still he pines:
That was where love was first found.

I'm the property man for this play.
If a gun is not working OK
For a scene, it's preplanned:
I'll move stealthily and,
With a cover gun, fire away.

The Black Knight, sometimes good, sometimes mean,
Star of comics and novels and screen,
Gallant horse by his side,
Wears black armour to hide
Who, before starting knighting, he'd been.

In flagrante delicto! I'm hosed
As I'm caught by my husband who nosed
'Round the shutterbug's studio
That captured me nudio
Conjoined with my co-star: X posed.

When I'm up in the morning at five
There is adequate time to arrive
At my plans for the day,
But time's frittered away,
Till there's no time for plans to survive.

Your limerick impresses and awes.
It gets four RFAs and applause.
Its approval's a lock—
Then you reel from the shock
As a prickly AE lists its flaws.

A laundry professor from Brighton
Wrote a paper he hoped would enlighten:
"On the Role of White Shorts
In the Spectator Sports:
Albificative Agents Can Whiten."

"You walk like a gimp; you look wimpy —
How 'bout if we just call you 'Limpy'?"
"My knee's hurt; my mammy
Says now my leg's gammy."
"She British? 'Cause here we say 'gimpy'."

I've a headache; I wish I were dead.
"Let's examine your brain," the doc said,
"Through a hole." At this juncture
Such craniopuncture
I need like a hole in the head.

I'm caught a bit short.  Got a buck?
Left my wallet back home in my truck.
Temporarily broke,
All I want is a Coke.
I'll repay you — no joke! (with some luck).

I noticed with utmost dismay
That attendance was poor at my play.
All the critics opine
That my writing's divine,
But the public refuses to pay.

"Such big eyes you have!" cried my advisors.
"And those teeth! You're just full of surprisers!"
"All galagos," I said,
"Are nocturnal. My head
(Lower jaw) holds fine toothcomb incisors."

Bright gaillardia blankets the ground;
In most states, its wild blooms are still found
In wide fields in the sun,
Forming seedheads when done.
Don't you see blanket flower? Look round!

A dispraisable fellow named Luke
Is the subject of constant rebuke.
Yet he earns my acclaim
For his rhyme-friendly name:
A phenomenal (nominal) fluke.

His Creation was just on its way
When, exhausted, God muttered, "Oy vey!
Since this timespan needs seven
New names now, Good Heaven,
I think I shall call it a day!"

A smart-aleck fellow named Treigle
Liked to lie and defraud and finagle.
While pretending to be
Deep and sensitive, he
Turned out centerless, just like a bagel.

GA stands for "Gamblers Anonymous",
A shelter for players who've gone amiss.
It saves bettors addicted
(Who should be restricted)
From vices they surely don't wanna miss.

I'd inspected the long ballot paper—
Selected a policy shaper.
The pen must have moved,
For much later they proved
I'd elected a prison escaper.

Conditions affect vegetation:
Ups and downs through the years—annuation.
When you've got things together:
Six months of dry weather.
(Farm success goes beyond cultivation.)

Though these islands are known as Canary,
With names it is wise to be wary.
Romans didn't, I've heard,
Confuse canine and bird —
No Canaries canary's that scary.

It's so boar-ing to live as a pig
So I'm tapping and learning to jig.
I'll wind up in New York—
Not as pork on a fork—
Forty-second Street, making it big!

I have on my workbench a mat
With a term on its back: antistat.
I wanted to be
Electricity-free,
So I rubbed it all over my cat.

Scoping an item on slides
Reveals what it formerly hides.
Destain it 'fore glassed
For views unsurpassed.
It's clearer and cleaner besides.

For the faithful, uncertainties vex,
Making science a pain in their necks.
Since there's certitude God
Can provide, it's not odd
Counterscience is strong in some sects.

If this limerick strikes you as harmless
(Though somewhat artistically charmless),
You've missed half its meaning.
To my comrades in scheming,
This Aesopian verse ain't alarm-less.

One time in Kentucky I saw
A fella who had a strong jaw.
When I asked him, "Do you
Know a word that means 'chew'?"
Though I reckoned he would, he said, "Gnaw."

The Palace of Westminster's where,
When he's dead, they will take Tony Blair
For a Lying in State,
An appropriate fate:
Lying statements were what he made there.

Define actorish? Some so-called "star,"
Hanging 'round in a theatre bar,
Who invariably tends,
With his thespian friends,
To exclaim: "Lovey dahling! Mwah! Mwah!"

I've deduced from your desperate state
A derivement  I need to relate.
As you stand on that ledge,
Looking over the edge,
There is little time left for debate.

We entered the pond for a swim,
Left the scum, and scrunched down on the rim.
I proposed midst old tires,
By the light of flies' fires;
All the ambiance of an old gym.

Nomenclature verification
Of chemicals needs a notation
Unambiguously clear,
But we really must fear
It's still hard to read "UPAChematian".

Your allowance you always exceed,
Buying stuff you don't pay for or need.
Shops send overdue bills
To your dad. We get chills
When we deal with your consummate greed.

Mom's old letters I found in the attic,
From her ex, were dramatic, ecstatic!
And as Dad's unaware
That the letters are there,
If I cite them, I'll be diplomatic.

Attacks?  And our borders are lax?
Politicians will claim those are facts.
Though the pols cite these stressors,
There are no aggressors.
Instead of attacks there's a tax.

"You say Franco-American, Betty,
Means it's French. I don't mean to be petty,
But just how did this name
Ever come to gain fame
In connection with cheap canned spaghetti?"

He worked close-up magic with me.
How it happened, I just couldn't see.
Subtle hands, easy chat,
And he had me — like that.
I just saw what I wanted to be.

The revenge I am plotting on Steven
Is emotionless; I don't believe in
A rage-fueled attempt.
Thus of wrath it's exempt,
For I never get mad, I get even.

The colors: the sure way to learn
Which horse leads as they come 'round the turn.
Colored silks make you able
To ID the stable:
Distant horses are tough to discern.

"After scoffing that pizza, I retched
All day long; waves of panic were etched
On my face.  Could have died!"
"What, from pizza? You've lied;
Just admit it's a little far-fetched."

For cragginess I would suggest
South Dakota's Black Hills are the best.
Narrow canyons, sharp walls—
Their rough loneliness calls
The world's heartiest souls to the test.

I've come into my grandpop's estate,
And there's tons of great stuff on my plate.
No more scrabbling about—
Gonna wear myself out:
Eat unwisely, live large, procreate.

Experimentally, Joe touched her arm.
She reacted, but not with alarm.
"Don't be shy," said her eyes,
So he tried for the prize.
She said, "Stop," but a sigh said, "no harm."

The doctor sat down and said, "Kate,
You are dangerously fat — overweight.
You have over-indulged
Till your stomach has bulged
And your heart's in a terrible state."

Daphne's Aged Goat Cheese Nick promotes,
And in every commercial he notes
That this cheese is the best,
And you need not be stressed:
"It is not made of milk from old goats!"

'61's "I'm a Fool to Care": you
Just might think it's Fats Domino who
Is the singer.  That's wrong.
It's Joe Barry.  This song
Was his top charting tune of just two.

Name three sports which face off. Now think twice —
After hockey (the sort played on ice),
Remember there's bandy
(Keep that nugget handy),
And a third? Well, lacrosse should suffice.

All his followers glorify Jim,
Heaping praise upon praise upon him.
He calls forth admiration
All over the nation
Though gullible, clueless and dim.

On the wall of a Mafia tomb
Is inscribed Bada-bing-bada-boom.
It's a phrase (like percussion)
For ending discussion—
Symbolically meant, I assume.

The analyst beggar was strange;
His routine he'd precisely arrange.
Using calculus math
He derived the best path
To get optimal rates of new change.

When there's beautiful music liturgical,
In context of services clergical,
I'd cut short the sermon
If I could determine
The best anesthesia surgical.

Attention, you moms with ambition:
The Junior Miss World Competition!
We'll strut your pre-teenies
On stage, in bikinis.
"Eroticize kids!" — that's our mission.

An Aussie may comment, "Fair dinkum!"
On a girl, or your house, or your income,
Or a book, or a show,
Or maybe a row
Of glasses of Foster's (then drink 'em).

Fifty gals, dressed as roosters, were crowing,
And this chorus line's crowd? Overflowing!
Yet all eyes were on Kate
(She was cock number eight):
Kinda plain, but a nipple was showing.

The derailleur that covers five gears
Is no match for the force of five beers.
Though the chain smoothly shifts,
After alcohol's gifts
The poor bicycle totters and veers.

One event's a required precondition
For another's successful fruition.
One is cause—that's correct—
And the other's effect,
Placed in limericked juxtaposition.

John F. Kennedy, once in Berlin,
Proudly spoke out in German: "Ich bin
Ein Berliner!" He told,
With a voice sounding bold,
Of a "war" called the "cold" we should win.

"Though the guard at the gate may be burly,
I sneak by every time," declares Shirley.
"Don't need tickets or cash;
There's no gate I can't crash...
Well, excepting just those that are Pearly."

Although males come equipped with two balls,
There are men who ain't ballsy at all.
Folks with guts are quite rare,
And they don't need a pair.
In fact, some gals are brimming with gall.

Bay Meadows: a racetrack out West;
It had always been one of the best.
Though the home to some firsts,
It fell prey to the thirsts
Of developers' race to  invest.

The arboreal people agree
That it's nice to reside in a tree.
I heard one of them say,
"When in branches I play,
Every day is gay Arbor Day! Whee!"

I dreamed that I heard the Lord mumble,
"I'll not make their edifice crumble.
But ten to one-twenty,
I think that that's plenty
To keep those cosmologists humble."

Whenever the dextrous succeed,
I'm unable to follow their lead.
These big clumsy hands
Destroy all my plans.
I'm a ham-fisted oaf, guaranteed.

The coverage of golf on TV
Seems a one-man exclusive to me.
Watch a couple of shots
By the Justins and Scotts,
But for Tiger, all seventy-three!

The gray rubber boa's a snake
That I saw way out west, near a lake.
It was smallah and slowah
Than others termed boa,
But its rubbery skin made me quake!

Melt sugar, then cook it to gold.
Add the soda, let bubbles get cold.
This puff candy's so sweet,
Crispy-crunchy to eat,
And addictive, your stash won't get old.

"Sometimes English, to me, is bizarre,"
Said Rudolfo, a famed limbo star.
"When I limbo, it's clear
That the goals I set here
Aren't made harder by raising the bar."

A person who meets you for lunch,
Or for dinner or breakfast or brunch —
Though a convive, it's true —
Has no duty towards you
To amuse, as you chatter and munch.

She has foul-in-the-foot, does this cow.
That's some foul-smelling foot rot — and how!
She acquired foul, alas,
When she pastured in grass
And in leaves that were wet — treat her now!

In a barrel? Go over? But who
Will go with me? It's something I'd do,
But I'm scared on my own.
I can't go it alone.
Please come over the falls with me too.

Breatharians' processes (inner)
Run on fresh air and light for their dinner
And breakfast and lunch,
But I have a slight hunch
That this far-fetched regime makes them thinner.

There's a shark at the beach.  He's not masking
Fearsome jaws, beady eyes, so I'm asking,
"Oh, you of sharp tooth,
Are we safe?  Tell the truth."
"Relax, I'm just lying here basking."

Purple coneflower, herbal of old,
Echinacea's tea for the bold.
Also known as black sampson,
This flower slaps clamps on
Fatigue that invites common cold.

A snail that got booed, 'cause he's slow,
Said, "I'll get a small car, and I'll show
A big 'S' on the door.
No Bronx cheers anymore:
They'll say, 'Look at that wee S car go.'"

It's a nucleus-free sort of cell
That we call the acaryote. Hell,
It's akaryocyte,
If you want it just right,
But akaryote works just as well.

Archie comics, I note with a frown,
For no links to real life wears the crown.
With five teens, it projects
Not a whisper of sex.
Does a malt shop exist in your town?

Yes, he's taken 'compassionate leave',
But he's not here to rest or to grieve.
No, he's managed to pounce
On some girl from Accounts,
And it's passion they've come to achieve.

Cytoskeletons obviate muddle,
Allowing a kick or a cuddle.
Their fibers, like spells,
Hold together our cells —
Without them we'd just be a puddle.

Once accourage (archaic) meant "urge,"
Till encourage began to emerge
Synonymously,
And sad we must be
For the death of this word: sound the dirge.

Every way you could measure or gauge,
Your project was once all the rage.
But today the boss said,
"Now your brainchild is dead.
It has reached the abandonment stage."

Classic writing outdoes the generic.
Ponder similes known as Homeric:
In his epic, the Iliad,
Sev'ral lines (not a chiliad)
Form word-pictures—bold, atmospheric.

Envision the hummingbird, reader—
Flitting lightly from flower to feeder.
Her swift daily duty
Embodies pure beauty,
And my columbines earnestly need her.

The "Wayfarer's Dole" at St. Cross
Is some bread and some beer (but no doss).
They are served on an alms plate.
If you don't keep your palms straight,
The dole will fall down, a dead loss.

When meat has been corned it's like beef
That's been pickled in brine. To be brief,
It has cured for three weeks
(Though there's other techniques);
It's delicious beyond all belief!

In the desert's unmerciful heat,
The legion was facing defeat.
Someone said, "Sound the bugle—
Though rations are frugal,
If we beat a retreat we can eat."

Our sick count's truly noble — a fount
Of good aid as our sufferings mount.
But we've always abhorred
That young profligate lord.
The son's no-'count. O, Lord, save our count.

Your cantankerousness is becoming.
You're as cranky as primitive plumbing!
How divinely you grouse
As you stomp 'round the house,
Your curmudgeonly footsteps a-drumming.

I know a young fellow, named Bill,
Who with cyclic disorder is ill.
He's an up and down lad:
Sometimes happy, then sad.
I do hope there's a suitable pill!

He's working for me and for you
In a job that the locals won't do;
He's that guy at the store
Who's employed while-U-snore—
Springfield's Kwik-E-Mart owner, Apu.

When I felt that I really must go
Pass my urine, my bladder said "NO."
How I needed to pee!
Now I'm cured—yessiree—
Because Flomax brought help with the flow.

He picked on the small guy — unfair,
And contemptible. Should I declare
My contempt for the brute?
I'd be next: I'll stay mute,
With a silent, contemptuous stare.

He sustained just a tap on the head, yet
That chronic complainer's in bed yet.
Mean as I-don't-know-what,
He's a BUNDY, hurt but
Unfortunately this bastard's not dead yet.

Fine cloth of Egyptian-grown cotton—
The stuff Cleopatra looked hot in—
Has both softness and sheen.
Cloth that's fit for a queen,
Once encountered, is seldom forgotten.

At departure they charged us a tax,
But collection procedures were lax
And they never got paid.
As we sipped lemonade
In Tahiti, they sent us a fax.

A behind-the-scenes view: look at me
Torture words anapestically.
As I struggle for rhyme
On the company's time,
I am torn into shreds by a WE.

Our Mary writes briefs that are weighty,
And with college professors she's matey.
She's been asked for advice
By the Pope once or twice.
She is quite able-minded for 80.

Though you're armored and trained for this fight,
Your opponent expects to find fright.
So, remember, Your Grace, mask
Your mien with that face mask.
'Neath your beaver, you're fierce. You're all knight.

It's the circus, a show in three rings!
In the first, a trapeze artist swings;
And in ring number two?
A parade from the zoo.
In ring three, trampolinists do springs.

He will green-light that project today.
Let's spend dough on it, gals, right away,
Or else we might find
That he's changed his dumb mind
And  rescinded his drunken OK.

The bluegrass and blackberry weeds
Are plants without sexual needs.
What gives 'em their kicks is
Prolonged apomixis:
They clone, on their own, all their seeds.

Take an artichoke, carefully skin it;
In the microwave, warm it a minute.
It's light green and pasty
And usually tasty—
But not if its heart isn't in it.

"From my builder's high standards, there's slippage.
In my hall, marble flooring shows chippage,
But what's worse," Bernie mutters,
"Is his placing of gutters.
When it rains, from my roof I get drippage."

The bindlestiff's ultimate goal:
Total freedom from outside control.
The hobo would pack
All he owned in a sack
(Called a bindle) he'd tote on a pole.

Bee-eaters are certain to please
If your garden is covered with bees,
And you don't eat their honey,
Or sell it for money;
They feast on bee-beasties with ease.

He's in candlestick telephone days,
Where a two-piece device is the craze.
One's an earpiece to press
To his pinna, and yes,
Here's a caller. She speaks—he obeys.

What's a dictionary?  Golly, beats me.
Haven't heard of that word… could it be
In this reference book
That lists meanings? Let's look—
Goodness knows I've my doubts, but we'll see.

His half-baked and vague delineation
Of programs to "heal our sick nation"
Helped win our affection.
He won the election,
And we wait, in widespread aggravation.

Though bacteroid (noun) is a term
For an oddly shaped kind of a germ
That is found on a root,
One of equal repute,
Found in sewage and guts, makes me squirm.

"Glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug!
Glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug!
Glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug!
Glug! glug! glug! glug! glug! glug!"
"Dammit, Josephine, put down that jug!"

I'm announcing my candidacy
'Cause the Senate needs people like me!
Like all primary winners,
My fundraising dinners
Are steep—but the ass-kissing's free!

We Americans think it insane
That in Britain a cornfield grows grain.
In that field you should raise
Cobs of corn, that is, maize —
But we're wasting our breath to explain.

Corti's organ's not something you play
To make music. It's tissue, they say,
That resides in the ear
And allows you to hear
Any sounds that are coming your way.

No support, no respect — there's a cost:
Once he taught and was loved; now he's lost.
Just this burnout remains
Of his passions and pains,
And those insults, attacks — he'll be tossed.

If you clam up, you feel your mouth dry,
As the panic sets in when you try
To breathe calmly to speak;
Words come out as a squeak—
But on stage, as an actor you'll die.

Of all animals, which would you say
Were the cleverest?  Mammals?  No way!
The smartest, most fly
Are ephemera.  Why?
'Cause these creatures weren't born yesterday.

From my works you may cite a small part,
Says the statute, but know from the start:
Follow rules of fair use
(Which are, sadly, abstruse),
Or my lawyers will tear out your heart.

The blue ice that shattered our ceiling
Left a hole, stains and stench — we're still reeling.
Local press got the scoop:
"Airline leaks frozen poop,
But won't pay so the family's appealing."

"Stir your drink, sir?" — but James Bond demurred.
"You should know that it's shaken, not stirred!
Though it sounds rather picky,
I once stirred a Mickey,
And woke up, my vision all blurred."

On a date, over wine and spaghetti,
I asked cryptozoologist Betty,
"Have you found in Tibet
Any Bigfeet just yet?"
She just smiled and responded, "Not yeti."

The news that your blood has dyscrasia
May gall ya, appall ya, amaze ya.
Ask your doctor what kind;
If there's treatment, you'll find
That the illness itself need not faze ya.

My date (like Madonna, but hotter)
Was pleased with the rifle I got her.
I invited the dame
To go hunting. "I'm game,"
She responded. Not thinking, I shot her.

To the conifers barely related,
We are cycads, and notably dated
To times Mesozoic.
Today we are stoic,
But too oft found in properties gated.

It's a case or a cupboard with doors,
A collection of stamps or of spores.
It's a room holding art,
Or advisors so smart
They've agreed to our President's wars.

Scott and Sandra's new pup (starter child)
Is a cockapoo. Mattingly's wild
In his leaps through the air,
Wavy apricot hair,
And the way that he's got us beguiled.

In Scotland my laddie (a boy)
And my lassie (a girl), with a toy,
Went to play near two cairns,
Having fun as two bairns
Would; they're kids—full of life, hope, and joy!

Though we don't share a father or mother
And our sisters don't know one another,
Since we cut both our hands
And our blood mixed, it stands
That he's properly called my blood brother.

Farrah Fawcett was, back in the day,
Drop-dead gorgeous, as many would say,
But in 2009,
We were forced to define
What that meant in a much different way...

There's a shark with a head like a hammer.
He's known for his prowess as rammer.
As butter he's blessed,
But as buttest, not best,
'Cause no fish has superlative grammar.

Most blowflies, to lay their eggs, seek
Raw wounds or dead flesh (that must reek!).
How odd, then, indeed:
The Calliphora breed
Means "the bearer of beauty" in Greek!

I must take to my bed right away,
As the day's been a proper affray.
I've been way over-taxed,
Not a minute relaxed—
And my mind says, "Let's call it a day."

She rehearsed throwing dishes at Brett;
The director was plainly upset.
He yelled, "That damn platter —
The thing didn't shatter!"
(He should know we've Corelle on the set.)

Diallelus: a logical goof
Where the premise is used as the proof.
"Eggs are round 'cause they're eggs,
Which are round." That's the dregs
Of an argument; better as spoof.

You're not stupid; it's well understood
You've two choices—but neither is good.
Both are far from okay;
If you thought you could stay
'Tween a rock and a hard place, you would.

I just moved to a heavenly farmplace.
It's a halcyon farm-with-much-charm place
With outbuildings — pretty.
Depressed in the city,
I needed this shot-in-the-arm place!

I bided with breath that was bated
And an anguish not easily sated.
My petitioning plea:
"Will you always love me?"
The answer to which I awaited.

You're apheliotropic, you say?
And a leaf or a root? That's okay.
So you know, it's the sun
And its light that you shun,
Always choosing to go your own way.

My doppelgänger, as you can see,
Is my twin, and the image of me.
So it seems a great shame
That we don't think the same—
In opinion, we never agree.

When chiding my friend (whom I like)
For riding downhill on his bike
By sliding and skidding
(Not gliding), I'm kidding.
He's hiding this thought: Take a hike!

While constructing a cupboard, a jerk
In the White House declares with a smirk,
"Let ol' Condi and Rummy
Both call me a dummy—
I'm proud of my cabinetwork."

"My boyfriend," said Jill, "is a pillar
Of society; Will is a driller."
"What? A sergeant who'll shout:
Forward march! Right about?"
"No, a dentist—both driller and filler."

This svbstance vnstoppeth the veines,
Is deoppilative, Venner maintains.
'Tis deobstruent, clearing
Obstructions and steering
Our humours to cheering our brains.

B. thuringiensis (Bt)
Is a germ that won't hurt you or me,
But a bollworm's thin guts
It'll rip into ruts,
Which is why all my cotton's GE.

Though he sailed Spraddle Creek with bravado,
The asthmatic yet fierce desperado
Succumbed there at dockside
To CO
While mooring at Vail CO.

Gobby Kay, always loud, has her say.
People's feelings don't get in her way,
Nor distinguishing fact
From fiction. With tact
Mouthy Kay isn't faintly au fait.

Ab inconvenienti: Let's take
Your foolish construction. We'd make
Every factory fold —
Workers out in the cold —
To protect this obscure little snake.

Something added that isn't essential
Is appurtenant (nearly tangential),
Like my post-lim'rick note,
Of which some might say, quote:
"That's exceedingly self-referential!"

Where the river meets up with the tide
Euryhaline-type crabs feed and ride
As they go with the flow—
Salt or fresh H2O.
Either way, they take all in their stride.

Brucella's a coccobacillus,
Parasitic and able to kill us.
Its deadly potential
Becomes exponential,
A very real threat which should chill us.

"An avenator—what would you say
Is his job? What's he do every day?"
"Does he fly in some show?
Does he vent something?" "No,
He's a merchant of forage and hay."

Jane's house wasn't clean, and its dustiness
Caused sneezing. What's up with this mustiness?
Jane complained: "I've got pain
In my joints. It's my bane!
I can't vacuum because of my rustiness."

The deodar, one kind of cedar,
Is large; among trees it's a leader.
In high mountains it's met,
In Nepal and Tibet,
Far away, I regret, my dear reader!

M. salmoides, a food fish, has class;
Not Big John: he will brag and harass.
They have one thing the same
(This comparison's lame):
A bigmouth's a bass or an ass.

The shopkeeper wished to contract
For arson, but not join the act.
To the felony, he
Would accessory be—
Before, but not after, the fact.

My lover was Margaret Sanger.
She'd fluster each time I'd harangue her
'Bout sex and say, "Please!
I am not your 'Maine Squeeze'!"
(You see, each time I'd see her, I'd Bangor.)

A discussion on birds, hard to follow,
Full of technical terms, I found hollow.
What I do recall most
Was the chairman's first toast
As he burped, "The return of the swallow."

Please don't consider me dim,
If I should go out on a limb
And state quite laconically
Aaronic, Aaronically
Meaning "of or relating to him."

I have fallen in love, and it's chronic.
My objectives are way past platonic.
The attraction is mighty,
And like Aphrodite,
I'd say that my flame is Adonic.

"I have read in my Hunting Dog Manual
That it 'springs' (that is, flushes)," says Daniel,
"The game birds, which fly,
To be shot in the sky.
Good old English (Woof! Woof!) springer spaniel."

Container port? No-one on earth
Would have chosen this place for our berth.
But in state we remain
At this site — mind that crane!
And of taxis, my dear, there's a dearth.

He jumped out the window. Ovations
Were heard down below. Salutations
Were given to all
As he took his great fall:
He'd ever loved defenestrations.

The wellsprings of English aren't boring
With rhymes such as this to be drawing.
Such a rhotical force
Is so common (or coarse),
Toffs and Yanks gladly share the deploring.

Raising crops where there isn't much rain—
On a steppe or American plain—
Can be hard, or alarming.
But now dryland farming
Replaces the pain with fresh grain.

"What's a bowdler?" asked Benjamin (but
First I'll mention this guy's off his nut).
"Bowdlers work with," I said,
"Iron ore, so I've read."
He responded then, "Iron or what?"

I fear that my online connexion
Is working in just one direction.
All the emails I send
To my old high-school friend
Go unanswered: I'm facing rejection.

Mummy's godlike, a goddess to me.
In her eyes gentle kindness I see.
She gives love, she gives care,
And her image I wear.
I revere her. Why not? I'm just three.

In an amphitheatrical dream,
The dramatist (you) has a scheme:
The actor (you, too)
Is in everyone's view
As you play out a tragic Greek theme.

Adjudication: the court won't impute
Any guilt in this legal dispute.
The defendant, we find,
Has no criminal mind
(And, to boot, she's just so doggone cute).

Beijing is as smoggy as sin:
Some days you'll just want to stay in.
If you're out and about,
Wear a mask—there's no doubt
That without it your chances are thin.

An archaic word's usage has charm
And this colony's no source of harm.
Its meanings are plural:
A settlement, rural,
Or a seventeenth century farm.

I'm dating a charming young lad
Who is always most dashingly clad.
When my debonair fellow
Wore suits pinkish-yellow,
He started an apricot fad.

A hazan is a synagogue chanter,
And ours quit (over pay, says the banter).
We replaced him, of course,
But, surprise!, with a horse.
You should see how that stallion can cantor.

My condition was fading quite fast,
So I had a new horoscope cast.
The star chart's prediction
Confirmed my conviction—
This ditty might well be my last.

Ol' Doc Phelps is a curer of ills;
He has lotions and potions and pills.
With his remedy kit,
He will soon have you fit.
But be warned: he sends very large bills!

Your interest rate must be amended
When seeking a loan that is blended.
And while the rate's less
Than on new loans, I'd stress
That your old rate cannot be extended.

I see bits on my salad and freeze,
For their sharp rancid taste does not please;
And I heave at the sight.
It's from Greece, colour's white,
Made from goat's milk, or ewe's: feta cheese.

She's engaged to that bald-headed bloke.
While he's telling his mates she's bespoke,
And they cheer and applaud it,
She's planning an audit;
She'll not buy a pig in a poke.

My name used to make machines flee.
'twasn't alphanumeric, you see.
They'd say "INPUT NAME? _____"
And then burst into flame
When I'd type "M-colon-slash-A-T-T."

The grysbok is small, brownish-red,
Has short, vertical horns on its head,
And is mainly nocturnal,
I wrote in my journal
In African Antelope Ed.

When my friends came to visit, our crockery
Was always a target for mockery.
Neither Wedgwood nor Spode
Had adorned our abode.
Still, the shards now look great in our rockery!

He's a secret that our family keep,
Our ne'er-to-be-mentioned black sheep.
Why do we insist
That he doesn't exist?
I can't tell you... the trauma's too deep.

While this panel keeps jabbering, I'm
Feeling angry. They're wasting my time.
There sit five stupid gents;
Each puts in his two cents,
But the workshop is not worth a dime.

What is data? A bundling of facts—
Joined in tables, or pie graphs, or tracts,
Or in lists—a collection,
Awaiting inspection.
Then insight, from facts, one extracts.

Greta Garbo did a Garbo: withdrew
From the limelight, amid much ado.
Enigmatic and proud,
She pulled back from the crowd
In her prime, but deliberately through.

Football face masks prevent nasty gashes
That might surface from violent mashes.
What QB was first
To prepare for the worst
By adapting a guard for such crashes?

Verses apothegmatical, with
A limerick's concision and pith:
Witty wisdom and more
In lines one two three four,
Then instruction arrives in the fifth.

If your body's attacked, it presents
You an immunogenic defense.
That response happens first,
Then a following burst
(Anamnestic, it's called) will commence.

Your fashion sense, not to be rude,
Is so totally, hopelessly skewed.
You're a mess when you dress!
Get some duds to impress!
Look, I'll help you turn dud into dude.

Celebrities, famous and rich,
Overnighting in London, will pitch
Up, direct from their flight,
At The Dorchester, right
Where it's at: five stars up from the ditch.

In a broken-down bistro in Bristol,
I was hit by a twit with a pistol.
Here's the wound, neath my knee.
Just look distad; you'll see,
Not the calf—no, the ankle (more distal).

An Ozian Cheese Hall of Fame
Is the place for Black Pearl, I proclaim.
The rind is all wrinkled
And lovingly sprinkled
With vine ash, which gives it its name.

"Mr. Christian, you clean up this spill!"
Said the stern Captain Bligh (the old pill).
"And use Bounty, it's quicker,
Or you won't get your liquor!"
"I'll set you asea, Cap'n Will!"

An awning of canvas gives shade
Over windows and doorways of trade.
This strong cotton canopy
Shelters a panoply
Of wares being proudly displayed.

In what language does that choir sing?
Are those Russian or Serb tones that ring?
Well, no matter the tonic,
It's still Church Slavonic—
To Orthodox priests the real thing.

My barber is also a seer,
Doing readings of wax, so his dear
And ceruminous whims
Oft accompany trims
Of the hair growing out of my ear.

The Beatles were modern and smart.
Their great albums had feeling and heart.
Add A Hard to Day's Night,
You have one from the height
Of their fame. It topped many a chart.

With grand rounds there's an audience there,
And the goal? Information to share:
New techniques, latest news,
Experts' medical views
On how best to improve patient care.

To the north and the east of Montauk
Was the range of the late and great auk.
But then hunters, a few,
With the last made a stew.
No one else heard this bird's final squawk.

High oration, that is the term:
This altiloquence makes a man squirm;
So when hard a golf club ya
Swing at balls like G Dubya,
Just ignore the prov'd truth and stay firm.

A bigmouth devoid of discretion
Not only revealed in confession,
But she blabbed in the pews.
Now we all know the news:
Father Vic is her carnal obsession.

If it's guns you're afraid of, please know
You're not gun-shy. It's simply not so.
That's a term to express
You're like me. I confess
It's loud noises I'd rather forego.

Our neighbors, dulotic, advance
And enslave half my family. By chance
I escape, but my brother
Is torn from his mother.
Write Congress? I can't. We're all ants.

Pa was set on becomin' a god,
So ways apotheotic he trod.
He per-oozed ant-eek tomes
And weird chants (them is pomes)
Until, poof! He turned into baked scrod.

Heard a sound, low, not clear, a dull thud.
The Duck came to a halt; what a dud!
This gal had no shame;
When I checked out her name,
What I saw was: Ol' Stick-in-the-Mud.

What's this creature I've caught? Cannot guess;
Horrid thing wants to eat me, no less.
Sharpened claws, odor rank,
Way too large for my tank —
Clearly lacking in domableness!

"Anacamptic!" I shout into space,
And it bounces right back in my face.
It's a word that reflects
Such echoic effects
As occurred in that just-mentioned case.

A venous anomaly nestles
In my brain, says my doc, so he wrestles
With cineangiography
(Moving photography)
Showing my cerebral vessels.

My points have been coming all day.
The bones have been rolling my way.
Cash in; let it ride?
With the dice on my side,
Should I pocket my profits or play?

Roll two dice; count the spots on each face;
Two and one means you've rolled a deuce-ace;
Add the total you see
And it should come to three —
That's the figure this phrase can replace.

A candler holds eggs to the light
To examine their contents by sight.
And those blood clots he sees?
Well, his eggs could be these:
Over easy—red, yellow, and white.

You're spineless — a creep and a flirt!
Keep your filthy hands out of my shirt!
Don't give me that frown,
You amyelous clown —
Even breaking your neck wouldn't hurt!

Where do Louis and Marvin abide
In adjacent graves (laid side by side)?
Just where can you see
Plots for big Joe and Lee?
From DC it is just a short ride.

Anglocentrism's likely effects
Would be these: in so many respects
Blair would do his own thing—
Not be led on a string
By a cowboy from Crawford, TX.

A "BOO!" from a ghost can be frightful.
"I'll get you, you bastard!"  That's spiteful.
But: "Sure, you can stay,
Since my husband's away"
Carries meaning that's simply delightful.

After goulash and gumbo, my ass
Was exploding with gut-wrenching gas.
But I know that I'll poop
And get rid of this soup.
As the adage says, "This stew shall pass."

When good sense was dished out, God forgot me.
Now on top of Boot Hill you will spot me.
Bart was breaking the law,
So I challenged him: "Draw!"
I'd just started my sketch when he shot me.

While rickets can make your bones weak
And pellagra discolor your cheek,
Acute beriberi
Can make you sick, very —
Of avitaminosis I speak.

My wife's lovely and lively: a catch,
And it seems we're a pretty close match.
But I've just met her sister
(Kind of sorry I'd missed her),
Who might be the pick of the batch.

One hot, lonely African hiker
Was chased by a swift, angry duiker.
As the guy ran away
He called out, "From this day
I am no longer hiker, but biker!"

"Defiguration's the key to this case,"
Said Holmes, as he studied the mace.
"Miss Vain isn't dead
Due to dents in the head —
No, she died from acute loss of face."

We were hot and sat under some oaks—
Two exhausted and thirsty old blokes—
When a woman said, "Hola,
Would you like a cola?"
"Señora, you don't have to coax."

Now I recognize nothing can last;
My seductiveness lives in the past.
My dazzle, all faded,
Though heavily aided
By chemistry, leaves me aghast.

Politicians exhibit efflation:
Puffing air. Such long-winded oration
Means blust'rous debate.
As their egos inflate
They blow smoke, with b.s. bloviation.

Yes, those penguins we saw at the zoo
In a group—that's a colony, true.
But it's frankly absurd
To employ the same word
For a bevy of nude people, too.

The Columbiformes' luck is a joke.
They're the pigeons that people provoke,
Or the sandgrouse that fry
In the deserts so dry,
Or the dodos, who jointly went croak.

"Ab absurdo: first off, your conclusion
(The moon guards our sleep) is delusion,
So your premise is daft."
Couldn't help it — I laughed.
Then he punched me and left this contusion.

Assessing this find was a pleasure;
The Old Masters bring joy beyond measure.
These fine brushstrokes make clear
That you've found a Vermeer:
A mature work, it's surely a treasure.

On the book that I wrote, I got feedback.
Reaction was harsh: "Don't proceed back
To writing another."
"Godawful!"  "Oh, brother!"
"What trash!"  "Waste of cash that I need back."

When a cause pulls my heartstrings, I yearn
To contribute each penny I earn;
I will do any deed
To assist those in need.
I get more than I give in return.

On a day he's fed up, King John ceases
To be nice, and a writ he releases:
"Lost love singers?   Let's slaughter 'em.
In fact, draw and quarter 'em.
I'm so sick of 'I'm Falling to Pieces'."

These "congers" aren't eels — they have legs
(Well, vestigial, eensy-toed pegs).
Got no eyelids nor tongue.
Though deserting their young,
Amphiumidae cherish their eggs.

Your values are sharply defined,
Absolute; you're so rigid of mind.
The prism you use
Just refracts in two hues:
Black and white.  Shades of gray aren't assigned.

Adult entertainment is honey
To a guy with an eye for a bunny
With a bod to admire,
As she strips her attire,
And her client of all of his money.

Fetch about, Cap; thar's weather ahead.
Change our tack or we'll all wind up dead.
This is hurricane season;
Ain't that enough reason?
My sweetie waits warm in our bed.

At Carisbrooke Castle near Ryde,
We were given an audio guide,
Which per audio text "showed"
Us King Charles' abode
Where his daughter Elizabeth died.

In old cities you'll commonly find
There's a large place of worship designed
To command the main square.
As a rule, folks stop there
Just to stare; few to pray or unwind.

There's one thing I can say without fear,
And elucidate plainly, my dear:
There are words, now passe,
Of no value today,
And dilucidate's one—that is clear.

Is this the best piece that I've got?
I'd say, "No, most assuredly not.
But I think it's on par
With my others so far—
About average—not righteous, not rot."

Some African tribes that are shrewd
Have adopted this plant as a food.
It's called elephant's-foot,
And ungraciously put,
It seems crude (though to say so is rude).

"Go about: 'handle'; 'circulate'?" "Yes."
"'Move from place to place'; 'deal with'; 'address';
'Change a sailing ship's tack';
'Do'; 'engage in'?" "You're smack
On the button. Your word skills impress."

I've been offered a bill of exchange
As a loan, which I'm thinking is strange,
Since its basis in law
Says I've money to draw
On anon; all I've got, though, is mange.

Have you heard of the fishes called dace?
They dart all about as they race!
There are various types—
Some kinds even have stripes—
And you'll find them in freshwater space.

After ten years of warring, let's stop.
We will spill no more blood, not one drop.
Assault that huge army?
No, that would be barmy;
We must, I repeat, close up shop.

Doug's a baby. The dog is a pup.
Are they cute to the max? I'd say yup.
Dog Eat Doug is a strip
Neither edgy nor hip.
That's why grandmothers eat this stuff up.

I could go by myself to a dance —
Find a girl, make an awkward advance.
But it's always, "No date,
Hon, you're too overweight;
If you're planning for later, fat chance!"

I'm brilliant!  A genius, alright?
I'm quick, and I'm clever, and bright.
When my lab's getting dim
And my eyes start to swim
Then it's night.  I should turn on the light!

Draw two lines across cheques that you pay.
Crossed like this, it's a shorthand to say:
"This is not for exchange,
Just deposit." Arrange
That you make every payment this way.

Our daughter's at that awkward age
When she bumps into things and can't gauge
If the girls in her class
Being mean will soon pass;
Thank heavens it's only a stage.

"Beads and trinkets!" he spat with disgust.
"I concede all the funds in our trust,
Plus the house and the car,
And my Fender guitar,
And then I get the dog? That's unjust!"

The Beatles were finally free
Of each other, but from the debris
Of the Get Back disaster,
Got Spector to master
A postscript that said Let It Be.

"Please stop cuddling that rat, as I fear
You'll be plagued with diseases, my dear."
But  this resolute lad
Was determined (and mad),
And he left with a flea in his ear!

Shake our dirt from your feet— leave today!
Wear your traveling shoes—do not stay!
Wave goodbye to your friends,
For your sojourn here ends.
We dister you; we drive you away.

You think air-con's a con, just hot air?
There are products that purify there.
And from me, the firm's rep, you rate a
Really great depurator
Deal — no more farts need you share!

In my yard, what I heard! Let me share—
Ol' G Dub told a shrub planted there
That his beard got a whack,
From the Aussie out back,
Guess which Bush is more dense. Do you dare?

The exequy (funeral rite)
Was scheduled for last Wednesday night.
His remains (now he's dead)
O'er his birth state were spread
By a Spad — like he flew  in our flight.

The Brits can be clever and charming,
Which makes it both sad and alarming
To see them in thrall
To a dead-end, brick-wall,
Ship-of-fools party bent on self-harming.

Getting shipwrecked on Lesbos was Ben,
Who learned women there don't have a yen
For the straight life, and so
Having nowhere to go,
He accepted his fate to date men.

Every decade I change my career.
The first used my musical ear.
I tried lawyering second,
Till  humor scribe beckoned.
What's next? I just can't wait to hear.

Where the summers are long, hot, and dry,
With the rain scant in winter, you'll spy
Vegetation—not lush—
Only thick, tangled brush,
Chaparral, underneath the wide sky.

If you speak of "warm red" or "cold blue",
That's a temperature and a hue;
Value shades dark to light;
Complementaries fight:
Colour properties name what you view.

Aptly called, since it means "deftly done",
A fair maiden named Crisply had fun:
With élan she might do
Something rude and taboo,
And conclude ere one knew she'd begun.

The hijackers took full control
With the Capitol Building their goal;
But the passengers learned
Of the towers that burned
And would execute bravely: "Let's roll!"

On July 31st  of this year,
We shall own this old house free and clear.
On that great paid-up day,
We will say, "Yay! Hooray!
That will pay for a stay in Tangier!"

Once arrested, the wealthy post bail
So they won't have to stay locked in jail
Till their trial completes.
They can then hit the streets,
But while free they must not hit the trail!

It's in juniper, quayside and gender,
Sometimes straight, sometimes down on a bender.
Though kids know it better
As a tail on a letter,
It's officially called a descender.

For the common bean — pods eaten green,
Or dried seed — many forms can be seen.
Appaloosa, black, white
Kidney, pinto ... All right,
So just which garden bean do you mean?

Flagella are found at the bases
Of certain cells vying in races:
There's one on each sperm.
Resembling a worm,
A flagellum (tail) helps it get places.

If you buy from some guy you don't know,
Here's advice: Please think twice; take it slow.
"Let the buyer beware"
Suggests caution and care.
Act in haste, you risk wasting your dough.

"The market's an art," said the chartist.
But now he seems more a con artist.
A stock's future's a mystery.
Using its history
As oracle isn't the smartest.

Croaked the witch, as she stirred her big kettle,
"I'm feeling in very fine fettle—
Full of vigor and life.
Now, where is my big knife?
Hors d'oeuvre Hansel was great; dinner's Gretel."

To Westminster Abbey, a stone
(Stone of Destiny, as it was known)
Was plundered in pillage
From Scone, a Scots village,
And doomed to lie under the throne.

Although folks like to make a connection
Between him and caesarean section,
Caesar came to this earth
Via vaginal birth;
So say experts by way of correction.

With a deficit, now it's transpired,
As accountant, you should have been fired;
For the total falls short
Of the figure it ought
To have shown, and the profit required.

Since a carb-loving barber named Barb
Loved to scarf the occasional carb,
She could easily harbor
A barber-sized arbor,
When garbed in her barbering garb.

In a full deck of cards there's a place
For twelve court cards (the ones with a face).
In blackjack, you'll win,
So just sit, stand, and grin
If you're dealt one of these with an ace.

Of anatomy facts a dispenser,
I never will edit or censor.
What extends or makes straight?
Why, that trait is innate
In the muscle we call an extensor.

In my bar the unfortunate Kate
Ordered drink for her man, on the slate.
I refused, and he cried,
"You fork off!"—I replied:
"No, it's you that should bifurcate, mate!"

Are better-off people more healthy?
They're not the top notch of the wealthy;
And their doctors will guess
That they suffer from stress
As the Joneses are creeping up, stealthy.

Your chuckles are put to the test;
Your guffaws are observed and assessed.
Cachinnation, we learn,
Is a function of turn.
Laughing last is the one who laughs best.

When the countdown had gotten to eight,
The platform gave under the weight.
For want of support,
We had to abort.
We'll rebuild and request a new date.

Mr. Casey is lacing the punch,
And refusing to nap after lunch.
At Green Meadows, they say
He's a wheelchair roué,
And the worst debauchee of the bunch.

A chemistry student at Bristol
Grew a perfect, symmetrical crystal;
But his prism was struck
By a hammer — tough luck!
So he shot himself dead with a pistol.

Islam's fatwas of death are providing
The West with good cause for deciding
To shun the Sharia,
For who wants to be a
Doomed Rushdie and spend your life hiding?

Ten million is known as a crore.
That's a one and then zeros galore
And two commas. I'd say
If a crore is your pay
Every month, I am yours, mon amour!

These woodlice, the pill bugs, are small
Gray crustaceans — not bugs, not at all.
A cute roly poly
Has gills (holy moly)!
Under threat, it rolls up in a ball.

Some folks, when they're stressed out or achy,
Submit to a treatment called "reiki".
("Laying hands is the key:
Subtly stimulate chi.")
Wakey-wakey, that's nuts—just plain flaky!

Stress the col, please, of colporter, for
Prickly peddlers of Bibles abhor
Being called a "coal porter",
Believing folks oughter
Not blacken their colportage corps.

From the bedroom next door comes a shriek.
With acoustic reactance, that's "Eek!"
So a passionate scream,
Through a wall, doesn't seem
Like a peak — more a satisfied squeak.

Violence never brings permanent peace.
Social problems aren't solved—they increase.
Down a spiral we fall
Toward destruction for all.
Understanding and brotherhood cease.

Oh no!  Hear that knock on the door?
It's that bloodsucker, asking for more,
That collector of debts,
Who will feel no regrets
When I'm ruined, bled dry on the floor.

There was "proof" I'd committed some crime.
My good name someone sought to begrime.
Then my alibi came up:
"This charge is a frame-up.
My client was dead at the time!"

'Blood relations' arrive. Bill denies
They're related: "Their claims are all lies.
They are chancers," says Bill,
Who declares in his will:
"Next of kin? I have no family ties."

There's a company symbol a-go-go
That is seen from two regions classed no-go
(Area 51's base
And low orbital space):
Colonel Sanders's corporate logo.

Computer Ops? What do you mean—
A job title or how a machine
Manipulates bits?
Or possibly it's
A robot repairing your spleen.

Their barrage blew our army asunder
Yet again—gave us reason to wonder:
Is our colonel too dim
To be following him?
Each attack seems a tactical blunder.

The judge has agreed to estop
The landlord who rents Pop his shop,
So her rent bill will topple.
The court used estoppel
To block a fraud foisted on Pop.

When you make an arrangement and feel
That it's honestly handled, the seal
Of approval's assured
And the outcome's secured
Since all's kept above board in the deal.

"Hey, Mom, I've a chance at my dream —
The X-treme Harley Acrobats Team!"
She frowned at me, scaring
Me out of my daring:
She eyebrowed me out of my scheme.

Your cheatableness is amazing!
(Your savviness ain't what I'm praising.)
Many times you've been duped
And your loot has been scooped
From your pockets, my bank account raising!

An assiduous surgeon named Gutting
Worked hard on his slicing and cutting.
Knowing patience would pay,
He would practise all day —
Though he sometimes lost patients while putting.

Dig those muscles — he's got him a slew!
No, no steroids at all; they just grew.
For cattle like that'n,
It's low myostatin
That makes for a prime Belgian Blue.

They say Crater was sent with a crow
By Apollo for water, although
Corvus took a long break,
Then came back with a snake.
Now they're all in the heavens, aglow.

When he wrote about odes that were Sapphic,
His paper was quite cacographic.
His spelling was bad
And his penmanship had
Enough dangerous curves to slow traffic.

With each episode, Ella's aggression
Succumbs less and less to suppression.
Each occasion makes clearer
That day's drawing nearer—
We'll call for some skilled intercession.

As I age, I grow glumly reflective,
Self-absorbed by my tissues connective.
I'm not so good bendin'
Each ossified tendon,
Since aspirin is now ineffective.

Prince Arjuna's pluck was defective—
He couldn't work up the invective
To fight his relations.
The transfigurations
Of Krishna restored his perspective.

Doctor Banner, I must diagnose
That you recently got much too close
To a nuclear blast,
And thus have amassed
A hulkingly large absorbed dose.

"I'm starving," the artist declares.
"Though I paint from the heart, no one cares."
Then today, boundaries stretch —
The first steps of a sketch —
And at last, her art's drawing some stairs.

A champion champer, one day,
Chomped his way down the Champs Élysées.
Le poulet? It was fine.
Escargots? Too divine!
But the offal? Too awful to say!

Ghostly footsteps on stairs that are creaky;
Or the monstrous, deformed, strange or geeky;
Something weird or malign
That sends chills down your spine —
All are aptly described to be freaky.

Compact's inked; we are one with our mates,
A now federated union of states.
But with most largely farmed,
And the urbanized armed,
Our young merger's in desperate straits.

Confrontational methods rehearsed,
In opposing her views, they're well versed:
Shouting down, turning backs,
Outright twisting of facts.
By these frictional foes she was cursed.

Come and feel all my muscles; they're weak.
They developed all wrong; I'm a freak.
It's called dystrophy, yes.
Why'd it happen? No guess.
Now it's medical info I seek.

A city on high's the Acropolis;
It stands far above the metropolis.
Here temples abound
Upon Greek sacred ground,
And the gods are the principal populace.

He's a ghazi, a master of war.
He has slaughtered our foes by the score.
Islam's enemies fall
By his mace or his maul;
He's already a figure of lore.

Let's go swim in the Gulf (how romantic!)
Where some turtles are gray and gigantic.
They're endangered, it's sad—
Numbers dropping like mad—
This poor ridley that's labeled Atlantic.

Our discussion's gone into a stall;
I'm not getting my point through at all.
Now your mind's closed as hell,
So I just might as well
Bang my head <<ouch!>> against a brick wall.

I'm a media darling held high
In regard on the news networks.  Why?
Whom they love, I respect;
Whom they hate, I reject.
If a mirror they want, I'm their guy.

When in Belgium, a source of vexation:
To speak Flemish or French? Just one nation?
Yes, Fleming/Walloon,
Are united — in tune,
Praising Stella. That's unification!

Why abide by such strictures? Unbend.
Self-denial's for what? To what end?
Why not turn a blind eye
To that "pie in the sky"?
One life's all that you've got; why pretend?

There's a paradox frequently seen
That concerns the "adult" magazine:
It's a feast for the eyes
That a great many guys
Look at only until they're eighteen.

From Coturnix, the Japanese quail
Is a bird with a stub of a tail.
Though the scientist's tool
In the lab, which seems cruel,
It's well-nourished—not thin as a rail.

If to conquer your cancer you strive,
And you're trying like hell to survive,
This new drug may help win.
There is platinum in
Cisplatin, to keep you alive.

Formosan—this word may not please
Those who favor the term Taiwanese,
But the folk on this island,
Both lowland and highland,
Are the ones with the most expertise.

Luma (brightness) and chroma (say, green)
Are combined, to be sent to your screen.
If not filtered with skill,
There'll be chroma left still.
That's when dot crawl  can clearly be seen.

I'll truck home in a convoy with flair,
In the center, the old easy chair,
Nice and safe, unexposed,
'Cause our backdoor is closed.
Biggest threat's from a bear in the air.

My banner is truly star-spangled,
As it hangs from a staff that is angled.
It's a flag that I please
To display in the breeze—
Would George Washington find it new-fangled?

My new girlfriend I'd like you to rate.
We'll go skating! A great double date:
You and Vi, Kate and I.
Though she's shy, kindly try.
Your opinion of  Kate I await.

As a prof, I can prove expertise
Just by writing pure academese:
Indigestible prose —
What it means, no-one knows;
But it's got me three higher degrees.

An extructor (a builder) named Heep:
"I build coops for small fowls that peep.
I don't charge you big bucks,
And my work's not deluxe,
But I'll do a nice job on the cheap."

I fear our Shar-Pei's one of those
Whose preference in food really shows.
She is pleased to partake
Of our pot roast or steak.
Give her dog food? She'll stick up her nose.

In our church there are candles and flowers;
The holiest pray there for hours.
"Stop war and disease,
And famine, and please,
Grant our ball team miraculous powers!"

In the bin, I deposit these things:
Old letters, two kites without strings,
Broken iron (not hot),
Some perfume my wife bought.
Oh, these ties! See the fun junk-time brings?

If you care for a friend quite a lot,
And are there when you're wanted, on spot,
Then for such bonhomie,
You could possibly be
Deemed a crony of someone, that's what.

A cross action filed by their faction
Is meant as a legal distraction
By those that we sued.
But I think it is rude
Since they don't lie in bed, legs in traction.

"Connate water," said Nate, "lies below,
Trapped in sediments formed long ago,
And it may be quite briny,
In pores that are tiny.
We can measure this dense H2O."

When her grandmother died, Trish would gush:
"Grandma left me some cash, and I'm flush!"
When Dad warned: "Don't be brash
With inherited cash,"
She'd feel truly abashed, and would blush.

Though he's Gascon, there's no gasconade
In proud Cyrano's speeches. He's made
Of such stuff that his boasts
Can withstand all riposts —
They're pure truth, without rodomontade.

"Joane, fartoo zo hachee?" (You're cross,
John, but why?) asked my boss.
He spoke, by-and-largy,
In old Forth and Bargy,
A dead dialect. Ah, zitch a loss.

When an aquifer's recharge location
Has a relative high elevation,
From artesian wells
Overpressure impels
An eternally gushing libation.

A wish-washy fellow named Walt
Would settle for what was default,
Until one day, a choice
In a jubilant voice:
"I'm taking my popcorn with salt!"

The communally owned village square
Is a nice piece of property, where
A developer, Paul,
Wants to build a new mall.
We refuse. It's a view we all share.

Reproduction by alternate means
Sounds like test tubes are merging your genes.
But when life's pictures fade
It's your camera that's made
Perfect copies of notable scenes.

"A break-in at Joe's?  Piece o' cake!
He won't suss that it's us on the take."
"That won't work, as our man
(I mean Joe) knows your plan,
Which is weak.  Walk away.  Joe's awake!"

The premise on which he was basing
His theory of timing and spacing?
Though bound to befuddle,
His "great cosmic cuddle"
Was deemed, it would seem, all-embracing.

The element chromium's metal,
And is part of my stainless steel kettle.
It makes rubies look red,
Fixes dye fast on thread
And on cars, leaves the shine in good fettle.

We won't dress like school-masters or -marms;
Though we fight, we will show off our charms.
We'll go sleeveless and dare
To display our arms bare.
You may say we are comrades in arms.

You cite details with great specificity,
So your story has ample facticity.
Truly, I'm awed:
You have proven there's fraud,
Not just pushing-the-limits duplicity.

I'm feeling quite wasted and weary.
The world looks unfocussed and bleary.
It's not long after noon,
But I'll have to sleep soon,
As my lunch was a little too beery.

If I'm aiming to pick up a gun,
My intent's to be brandishing one.
 If I'm aiming at you,
 You're the target I view,
So I humbly suggest that you run.

Stuck at home getting bored, what a day!
What you need is a fun game to play.
This compendium (box
Full of games) really rocks—
No more grey. Quick, let's play sans delay.

Bully's stance, Vlad bromance, "We're not great!"
"Build a wall!" "Ban them all!" Fear and hate.
Disses Jeb, trashes John,
Marco? Small. Angers Khan.
Without end, he'll offend, he'll berate.

Now Aachen's a fine German city.
Stroll through it; you'll find it quite pretty.
Yet during the War
Its enemies swore
They'd destroy this great place; what a pity.

When faced with that challenge, you ran.
When life throws you curveballs, your plan
Should be tackling these things
With the courage of kings.
Have some balls!  C'mon, Ann!  Be a man!

Absorb means to soak or take up,
Like a biscuit or bread in a cup
That will soak up the drink
Just as quick as a wink —
Which will mean that you don't have to sup.

Got two coins for my birthday from Noah;
A hundred would make one balboa.
These centesimos are
Of less value by far
Than a dozen or so protozoa.

"Cement Mixer," it went, "Putty Putty."
This song that was just a bit nutty
For a while was a fad—
Ask your mom and your dad.
It was cute, they'll recall, and not smutty.

Radiation that's cosmic pervades
All of space, and its presence persuades
Many folks to infer
The Big Bang did occur,
For without it, the evidence fades.

As the time-honored Beaufort scale reads,
A fresh breeze blows at well-defined speeds,
To wit, eighteen or more,
Not above twenty-four
MPH. That'll scatter some seeds.

"I don't love you." (It sounded rehearsed.)
I would lie if I said my heart burst.
'Tween the rumble of thunder
And love—which, I wonder,
Can manage to die away first?

I'd been walking on air all my life
When one night I heard this from my wife:
"I just cannot extol
Your technique, on the whole."
(Innuendo can cut like a knife.)

Blue cornmeal makes savory chips
That look neat beside salsas and dips.
If your waiter's a guy
Who keeps up the supply,
Be sure to leave generous tips.

On political so-called correctness,
I spit, for it spits on directness.
You may play craven games
And invent inane names,
But do not seek from me such abjectness.

Gypsy skirts, spirits free, boho ways
Are a floaty, free, fun fashion phase.
Deviate from the norm:
That's the way to conform.
"Come on, we all do it these days!"

Though partial to bird, mouse and rat,
The civet's more mongoose than cat.
Near its butt there's a gland
You can scrape out by hand
To get musk, if you're looking for that.

The cruciform veg is a beaut.
With turnips, you eat leaf and root.
The bud (not the flower)
Is broccoli's power.
It's all sounding brassica. Toot!

Here's the process of biofiltration
For raw sewage—try this explanation:
Good bacteria munch
On our waste for their lunch,
Decomposing it for the next station.

She plays ringer with neighborhood girls,
Using marbles with colorful swirls.
Since their marbles are plain,
They will try to obtain
The magnificent cat's-eye she hurls.

The carpet is threadbare. A path
Has been worn from the door to the hearth.
See the scuttle — admire —
It holds coal for the fire
Which heats water to fill the tin bath.

On our commonage—there sheep and cattle
Graze happily. Landsmen know that'll
Keep our village at peace.
Should our town charge to lease,
Then our men are prepared to do battle.

By acting so brainsickly, Grange
Has exposed his disorder (it's strange).
In a crazy display,
He sings "cantaloupe play"
With the deer on a "home on derange."

A good  winter coat is the duffle;
It's cosy and hooded to muffle
You up in a storm —
You'll stay toasty and warm.
Should the duffle not muffle, its fluff'll.

A soprano from west Bujumbura
Sang opera with verve and bravura,
Excelled at Bellini
And conquered Rossini—
A diva, a coloratura.

Saint Adomnan's gentle demand
Was that killing of women be banned:
"If you slay one," he said,
"We shall have you struck dead—
But we'll first axe your foot and your hand."

I wanted to write of aboulia,
Defining it fully to schoolia.
But my willpower's lost,
And we'll both bear the cost
Of a mindset that does overrulia.

Abdominal pregnancy can
Be a danger throughout its full span.
When gestation's ectopic,
Unless you're myopic,
You'll work with your doc on a plan.

They have opposite meanings, they do:
Black and white, tall and short, shrunk and grew.
And "His name is anonymous"
Is surely antonymous
Like "Welcome, I bid you adieu."

Well, first I said "Howdy!" to Steve;
Startled Ann—had "Yo, dawg!" up my sleeve,
Then "Whassup!", "Hi" and "Hey!"
"Hail," "Ahoy! and "G'day!"
That is how I spent All Hallos Eve.

As a yellow-brown poisonous salt,
Is this cadmium sulfide at fault
For the retches and heaves
Of that meanie, Miss Reeves,
Who's the teacher I just served a malt?

For this bullfinch, the Azores are home.
He's a songbird unlikely to roam.
To the birder's despair,
He may soon be as rare
As a baldheaded man with a comb.

I can dig out my car when it snows,
Or the mucus gone hard in my nose;
We can dig in at dinners,
Discuss local  sinners,
And dig up some dirt about those.

Al-taschith, in the temple's employ,
Was a singer who gave David joy.
To the Maestro, we read,
Al-taschith. And we heed
Al by saving his psalms: "Don't destroy."

Caliche's a gravel or rock
Bearing nitrate—a salt kept in stock
By the gunpowder makers,
The farmers with acres
Of crop-growing land, and my doc.

My neighbors above never tire
Of tumult, dissension and ire.
Their life's just one broil.
I'd seethe them in oil,
Or cook them well-done on a fire.

I awoke every morning and cussed.
In my eye sockets, fingers I thrust
To remove the debris
From my eyes so I'd see.
Decrustation each day was a must.

My confirmator's here. He will try
To validate facts. He's the guy
Who confirms or rejects
What folks say, and detects
If they're truthful or telling or a lie.

When Sinbad went sailing he knew
There were monsters he'd have to pursue.
But the cyclops' greeting
Foretold a fine meeting,
"Been keeping an eye out for you."

"In my Favorites menu," said Ken,
"I've got thousands of bookmarks, made when
I was busy or tired.
Now the links have expired
And I can't find the pages again."

A dag is, with people, inept —
Maybe nerdy. The word hasn't kept
Its original sense
Of a (don't take offense)
Tough eccentric—but one we accept.

The author felt gypped, and he flipped
When he found we had hidden his script
In a cryptal retreat
Neath the churchgoers' feet—
Buried deep and unread in a crypt.

You're a diplomat, keeping your cool,
Once you finish diplomacy school.
All its diplomates state
That they don't get irate
When they're baited by fools, as a rule.

This measure of liquid, in short,
Is about two Brit pints, or a quart;
With a chopin to drink
You'll forget how to think—
Lots of port, I report, little thought!

Supraorbital ridge on me face
Make me eyebrow stick way out in space!
Plus me head kinda flat.
Many people say, "Gat
Look like caveman." So me know me place.

"See this patch, where it's thick in the stroma
Of your dermis? A large dermatoma
Is growing. I'll cut!"
"I'll agree to that, but
I insist that I see your diploma."

Science fiction, when put to the test,
Has one show that outshines all the rest.
It's got gritty reality
Shunning banality —
TV has Blake's 7, the best!

If to good old caffeine you're addicted,
Your behaviour can thus be depicted:
You are jumpy and mean
Till you get some caffeine,
And no more with distress you're afflicted.

I bought all the bargains, of course,
Like that whip, without buggy or horse.
But the next day I knew
(With my rent coming due)
The true meaning of buyer's remorse.

If you're Welsh then this emblem will speak
In much the same way as the leek
(A symbol more silly
Than the daffadowndilly):
The daffodil holds great mystique.

Achromatic describes this cell figure.
Cytochemicals' usual vigour
When staining will dwindle:
It seems the cell's spindle
(Mitotic) resists dye with rigour.

An old prioress, stuck in her priory,
Wrote her fantasies down in a diary.
When she died, it was found.
People passed it around.
The result was a papal inquiry.

I'm in Cabo San Lucas, a town
Of increasing cachet and renown.
This Pacific resort
And peninsula port
Is a jewel in the Mexican crown.

Where'd we sit if we didn't have chairs
To support 'take the weight off' affairs?
A posterior something,
A 'sitting on bum' thing,
A place for those soft derrières.

Still performing, four decades and more,
They're Chicago, though changed from before,
Rebuilt from the era
Of Peter Cetera,
With alternate paths to explore.

My euphoria led to despair
On a back breaker trip — don't know where.
Sounds and colors were busy.
I was anxious and dizzy.
Now I'm home.  The Lord's answered my prayer.

About her, for ten years he'd not spoken,
Till at last his long silence was broken.
Although grief had defined him,
He put it behind him,
And a new life that day was awoken.

My collar is aquamarine.
That's a color, a nice bluish-green —
Unless (is this true?)
It's a nice greenish-blue.
Well, whatever, it has a nice sheen.

The greatest thing ever invented
Is cleavage, when amply presented,
For a jaw-dropping stare
At an eye-popping pair
Is a joy, when they're boldly un-tented.

There are fifty-four faces in six
Vivid colours that make quite a mix.
To play with this cube
You should not be a rube —
One colour per face is the fix.

Each family has its black sheep,
A notorious, ne'er-do-well creep.
He's a brat and a liar,
A rat and wolf-crier,
Who's good only when he's asleep.

The creed of our newest foundation—
For animal equalization:
No creature's superior
And none is inferior.
Crustacean is peer of Dalmatian.

The people of interest to me?
Unbowed émigrés, those forced to flee.
By those tough ones I'm fascinated:
Uprooted — deracinated —
Like Dad, a bereft refugee.

Um ... just lately not mind's my at ease.
When I thoughts to ...  try think just I freeze
Thoughts putting together ...
I'm wondering ... whether
It's Alzheimer's, that not ... no please!

Just the touch of Cnidaria stings.
They sport cnidocytes — nasty wee things,
Each a mini-harpoon
With tiny barbs strewn,
And hollow (for venom) small strings.

There's no honcho who'll broker a truce
In disputes with the Canada goose
(Noisome urban intruder
Who grows honkingly ruder) —
To the rules in our parks he's obtuse.

In combat-engaged situations,
Confusion and miscalculations
Can happen.  The more
Fog of war for one's corps,
The less dominance shown by their nations.

Climbing maidenhair seems to evince
How Rapunzel was saved by her prince.
But in real life, we learn,
It's a fast-growing fern
That makes folks down in Florida wince.

This painting portrays an old Druid.
One can see, if it's properly viewèd,
There's a bump on his nose,
Which may be, I suppose,
Something cystiform, filled with a fluid.

When foes frame the argument, you
(If in favor of choice) will construe
Their "pro-life" as a ruse
That they use to confuse;
You're for life, but with quality, too.

There once was a lady, in fiction,
Who had an unusual affliction:
She emitted a shriek
When she started to speak,
And insisted it aided her diction.

"The buff-bellied hummingbird: where
Would one find it?" asked game-show host Blair.
"Would that bird be in Texas?"
"Yes, you win the Lexus!"
Oh, I knew that one! Wish I'd been there!

Sheherazade's spellbinding tales
Are of magic and misfits' travails.
Dusk to dawn she recites
The Arabian Nights;
Won't unveil every tale—and prevails.

Folks in Iowa tend to hate spice,
And garlic they think is "not nice."
For those in that land,
The bland leading the bland,
Salt and pepper are thought to suffice.

Since Marquita's sick thyroid's a quitter,
Swollen up like an Eve's-apple fritter,
Zap it dead! What intrigue!
She needs antifatigue:
Bottoms-up! She'll get better...or bitter?

Your endearing sweet chuckles and yelps
Make me think that you must be a Phelps!
You're delightfully funny
With your hair dripping honey.
You don't have to be mad but it helps.

I think I will croak! My throat's sore!
There's a froggy in there, and what's more,
He has stolen my voice,
So I croak! I've no choice!
I will choke 'til I croak on the floor.

At high school our teachers weren't sages.
Said a lazy one, "Copy out pages
(Say) eight to fifteen."
That was that! I'd not been
So damned disillusioned in ages!

You get emotionate, over-emphatic —
Hands waving, eyes crazed, operatic.
Who's emotionless? Me.
When you're out of your tree,
One raised eyebrow you'll see — I'm phlegmatic.

Adaven's a town in Nevada
Whose name you will notice is odd—a
Reverse of the state's
Appellation that rates
It a limerick, if not a Ramada.

At Delta, we worship the souse;
Think of Wormer the Dean as a louse;
Hate Omegas and smarties;
Wear togas at parties.
We rock at the Animal House!

Consider the poor autogyro;
It appeals less to airline than tyro.
These aircraft with motors,
Propellers, and rotors
Won't get you from London to Cairo.

Have a sip of rhetorical Snapple—
With antilogism we grapple:
No apples are dishes;
Some dishes, delicious—
Delicious cannot be an apple.

A unibrowed star from Pawtucket
Made a salon appointment; said, "Pluck it!
I've closed playing Frida;
As Carmen, I need a
New look, and I'll pay you a ducat."

"It's felicitous you should wear white,"
The Grim Reaper declared, one dark night,
"For your suit is your shroud."
The man, briefly, looked proud,
Just before he dropped dead of pure fright.

Our black mulberry tree, every May,
Hosts a riot of robins at play.
There they nest, lay eggs, chirp,
Ripened berries decerp,
And gulp fruit that's decerpt, plucked away.

It's held mice, handled joysticks, and more:
Ancient Teletypes, networks galore.
Early DOS owns the fame
For securing the name
Of the COM port, COM1: 2: 3: 4:.

A condition of infants with low
Butterfat in their diets may show
In their eyes.  There may be a,
With dacryorrhea,
Tear discharge excessive in flow.

The traders who work at this branch
Made our managers visibly blanch,
Since their currency trade,
Losing more than it made,
Was effectively betting the ranch.

I'm expunging this line so you'll see
What this editing term means to me.
In this way, I'm assured
The line's meaning is blurred
To a greater or lesser degree.

We have fab beauty treatments. Our spa
Doesn't mind how repellent you are.
Is your hair dry and sparse?
Do you have a huge arse?
Come in startling, and leave here a star.

This lake's full of marvelous fish.
They're contented as most fish could wish;
Jack salmon are they,
And, when spawning, betray
Their abdominal fins, which they swish.

"Change the baby," she called from the door.
He's my boy, so I've managed before.
I inspected his nappy:
As expected, right crappy.
She's come home: "He's just done a bit more."

That young lady who seems to be winking
Isn't really flirtatious, I'm thinking.
That's blepharospasm
(My grandmother has 'em):
Spasmodic, repetitive blinking.

With my fiberless diet, I skulk
To the toilet to struggle and sulk.
For more roughage, I'm told,
Get a cereal sold
By the name of Incredible Bulk.

Why do we call autumn "the fall"
When all other seasons we call
By one name? Could it be
Autumn leaves on a tree
Which flutter to earth, one and all?

When it comes to the discharge of waste,
Be discreet as to where it is placed.
Be it large or petite,
When you need to excrete,
Please ensure that it cannot be traced.

A bag lady knocked on my door,
And I knew I had seen her before:
Her belongings in bags,
She was dressed in old rags;
I said, "Mom, don't come knocking no more."

Bloviation poured out of his spout,
So I took my anemograph out
And I measured the speed
Of his hot airy screed:
Twenty bromides a minute, about.

Let's bid hydrogen chloride farewell;
It is toxic and has a bad smell.
So we'd better just de-
hydrochlorinate, see?
If that fails, then get out, run like hell.

Up on top, it's a kind of a hummock,
But below, it hangs down like my stomach.
Metal hulls pay a price
Underneath polar ice
When a submarine bumps on a bummock.

He enjoys hurting people, and he
Is aroused and turned on by the spree.
All this pain will ignite
Algolagnic delight —
What a sadist he's turned out to be!

Ivan Pavlov made use of a bell
To condition his pets to its knell.
His dinnertime rule
Meant the canines would drool
For the food that the bell would foretell.

A basic skill's walking the line:
One foot, then the other — just fine.
But my muscles won't work:
I don't walk — I just jerk!
Abasic, I have to recline.

Squiggled means of expression need praising.
This stanza at which you are gazing,
Like all thoughts of jerks —
Even Shakespeare's full works —
Used but twenty-six letters. Amazing!

Did you see that old movie, Algiers?
The Frenchman and Hedy in tears?
"To the Casbah please take me
And never forsake me"—
Such words linger on through the years.

A fellow who lived near the Tiber
Ate poorly (a heavy imbiber).
His bowels were packed—
Not impacted, in fact.
Said his doctor, "Eat bran; you need fiber!"

Dating Jill was my plan; I commenced it,
But hopelessness hovered — I sensed it.
My efforts would stall;
She put up a brick wall,
And my head started banging against it.

Cotyledonary leaves first appear
To announce the new true leaves are near.
These latter will show
Which plant is to grow —
Cotyledons are never too clear.

In floodwaters, staying afloat
Calls for use of a watertight boat.
Or, if plucky (and lucky,
And sans rubber ducky):
Hold tight to a backstroking goat.

Your double-faced bookshelf provides
Ample shelving for books on both sides,
But placed in the hall,
Flat against the hall wall,
Half the books you have stored there it hides.

Said a virus of breed misanthropic,
One of humankind's foes microscopic:
"I'll be lunching at Belle's.
I'm in one of my spells;
I feel drawn to her cells—cytotropic."

"Please bury my brother," she cried.
When Antigone's plea was denied
She took her own life,
Which resulted in strife,
And the death toll refused to subside.

The screw found its pathway just right
And was countersunk, fitting real tight;
Topped with liquefied wood,
The job looks pretty good—
What I mean is, the screw's out of sight.

The ablaut, a German root's "herb",
May be "plucked" when inflecting a verb,
As in fly, flew, and flown,
But not cry, crew, and crone.
Such examples don't help—they disturb!

The canny Canadian lynx
Looks askance at the bobcat and thinks,
"We could probably mate,
But I'm too overweight,
So he'll think I'm a slob, not a minx."

When she dies, I am hoping dear Gramma
Will leave me her coat—a Blackglama.
It's a beautiful mink
And I'll wear it, I think,
Though I'm living in south Alabama.

Our land was beset with the famine.
Our butties would never have ham in!
We'd no wheat and no barley,
Then good old Bob Marley
Brought us doughnuts, his fav'rites — wi' jammin'.

See my destituteness? I've got less
Than a beggar: one drab threadbare dress.
My sole hosiery has holes
Like my shabby shoes' soles,
And my odor's old cod, I confess.

These paintings of nudes, understand,
Are not porn and they shouldn't be banned.
While erotica teases,
It tastefully pleases.
Curators retain the whip hand.

A marriage can be like a horse—
A thoroughbred running the course.
It may run very well,
At least for a spell,
But the finish line?  That's a divorce.

When my dad was a surgeon he went
Every Christmas to hospital, spent
Lunchtime carving the bird—
Though the patients preferred
Christmas pudding, one hundred percent!

A lopsided lady named Greer
Has breasts of two sizes, I hear.
Her unusual pair
Means she simply can't wear
An axisymmetric brassiere.

If it's cold, and you're out, you'll feel chilly,
And to crave something hot isn't silly.
My advice (it's no blarney):
Try chili con carne.
You'll find yourself warmed, willy-nilly.

I suppose I should plan on resuming
Some attention to personal grooming.
People constantly stare
At my teeth, nails, and hair
'Cause they're nasty. Or so I'm assuming.

Sad American wakes sent the States
Lots of Irish with hopes that the fates
Would help them do well.
All those wakes failed to quell
Their great fears in those times of dire straits.

I'm sure it's a plumb full of joy church,
But is it a girl or a boy church?
There's a sign ... I pass by
For I fear they're too shy
And they'd never reply down at Coychurch.

Barry Bonds crushes balls with his swing.
His power made Giants fans sing.
But if Barry took 'roids,
He potentially voids
Any claim to be called "Home Run King".

Dressed in lycra, to thrill boyfriend Mike,
When long-leggèd Lou mounts her bike,
She glows in her pose,
For she knows that she shows
That part of a body men like.

A carryback's used for a loss
That's sustained in a year, so my boss
Says, "Deduct it from what
I earned last year; I've got
A few taxmen I'm hoping to cross."

Some classes were made just to pain us —
Take mythology. (Please! It'll drain us.)
Start with Old Father Time's
Most unfortunate chimes
With Cronus, the son of Uranus.

The crazier, viler the creed,
The greater the effort you need
To believe. And the strain
Of belief turns your brain
To a bog wherein bigotries breed.

The Barbie drug's sold on the Net.
A tan isn't all that you'll get:
A reduction in weight
And, for guys, a stiff state.
Too good to be true?  A safe bet.

From Bushwick to Flatlands to Coney,
Often rough, but don't label it "phony"—
Spike Lee named it "Crooklyn,"
But to most, it's just Brooklyn.
Nevuh hoid it? Ya fulla baloney!

Well, sink me! That salt is a gannet:
A most ravenous seaman, that Janet.
She wants more than her measure
Of plundered food treasure —
The greediest tar on the planet!

In cities with streets upon streets,
And cross-streets, which each of them meets:
Watch rectangles form
(Not squares, as the norm)—
Called blocks, as the pattern repeats.

Echoencephalograms help obtain
Useful views of a baby's small brain.
As its soft fontanelle
Is adapted quite well,
Information on structure we gain.

"The science of gases at rest
And of lighter-than-air craft," she stressed—
"In short, aerostatics—
Ballooning fanatics
Must learn for the licensing test."

In Ireland, a wandering togue
Was swept out to sea. In his brogue
He inquired, all aquiver,
"Oh, where's the Roe river?
Its mouth is my sweet disembogue."

"Lord, I've got the base crazies!" sobbed Zack,
"So stay off of the carpet. Get back!"
Shaking, shivering, he's
On his hands and his knees
As he searches for coke or for crack.

"I'm a cave salamander," says Mel.
"By a stream cloaked in darkness I dwell.
Small crustaceans I eat.
Though I'm blind, they're a treat
That I search for and catch by their smell."

With language, let's play a fun game
Twisting titles, one letter per name.
"British Airways," we'd say,
"Could become Brutish A."
"Our service is bestial!" they'd claim.

The Galápagos tortoise has fame
For the length of its life. There's a claim
One of these once survived
Years one-seventy. It thrived
In a lifestyle both captive and tame.

Is he prophet or quack? Peter Breggin
Says, "Psychiatrist colleagues, I'm beggin'!
Don't start patients on psych meds.
In their brains, I don't like meds,
Though Big Pharma may sneer, 'Breggin Shmeggin!'"

Garlic oil may be said to consist
 Of nothing that science has missed.
 Without further ado,			
Then, within this fine brew,
You'll find alliin crystals exist.

My gal's callipygous. I find
That she drives me so out of my mind
That wherever I'm going
I bring her, thus showing
I can't bear to leave her behind.

Found some manuscripts, timeworn and rare,
At an auction on Christopher Square.
Bought just one; I can't buy ya
Another Messiah.
The package reads "Handel with care."

I cry to be heard in this rhyme.
Bush is sending our boys in their prime
To a war that is lost.
Who can fathom the cost
In young lives? Is their blood not a crime?

See this vase? It's antique: Elizabethan.
An investment, it's prime for bequeathin'.
It's 400 years old,
And it's inlaid with gold.
(Grandma bought it to keep her false teeth in.)

A fawning, obsequious guy
Who's polishing apples can't buy
That place in a heart
Which sets one apart
As the apple of somebody's eye.

It's Cup Final Saturday!  We
Won the semis v Portsmouth 4-3!
Now we've reached the last tie,
With a tear in my eye
I can say we've arrived — WEM-BER-LEE!

There's a menacing threat you can make:
Make my day! It's a route you can take,
And the tipping-point grows
To the face-off, he knows,
Situation-wise, means: make or break!

The bridegroom from Brooklyn, I guess,
Was under unusual stress.
"Hey! Duh bridal gown's red!
Man, I ain't gonna wed
Any damsel," he said, "in dis dress!"

Hard eight — play the line — easy four:
At a craps table (not on the floor)
A box man splits chips
With his deft fingertips,
Collects or pays out when you score.

It's all over; relax awhile now.
Let this eye pillow rest on your brow.
It will block the harsh light
With a pressure just right.
You need soothing—the eye pillow's how.

You must think me a gullible guy
If you thought lame excuses I'd buy.
It's my leg that you pull
With an old cock-and-bull
Kind of story. It's garbage. Don't try.

Due diligence: God, what a drag!
Endless research to find a red flag.
You know what? Life's too short.
Buy my hedge fund, old sport—
Got to zig where those painstakers zag!

I often work late; Mick gets surly.
Today, home at six, I am early.
In our bed I find Mick,
Though he doesn't seem sick.
(Who's this chick he keeps calling "Nurse Shirley"?)

A basilican church is called dromic
On account of its shape ergonomic;
It's based on the courses
They used to race horses—
I find that analogy comic.

The coffin was placed catercorner
At the funeral.  There as a mourner,
I said, "Surely this change
In the setup is strange,
And for me, makes the service forlorner."

We could get in some serious spats
O'er the merits of ferrets and rats.
Eco-nut, I would clasp
Every wasp, skunk and asp —
Here's the nice thing I'd say about gnats:

Made of bottles (small bundles) of thatch,
On our cottage, the eaves don't quite match.
No, that's not a complaint;
We like old ways; they're quaint.
And our capable thatcher's a catch!

When combined with a noun, the word aided
Denotes that a job's been upgraded
Or bolstered—like, say,
How computers today
Have all aspects of business pervaded.

Now that SCOTUS has backed the cake maker,
Where should gay couples go for a baker?
Perhaps we can draft
A new name for a craft
That serves LGBT folks. A gay-ker?

It was fun when we kissed and we flirted,
But the sexual skills she exerted
Were far from conventional;
I'd rather not mention all
We did—let's just say, I'm converted!

He gave me a kiss, continental,
On the hand, and a smile very dental—
That smooth European;
But I longed to be seein'
Some diamonds. (Now, don't be judgmental.)

That fellow is ogling my bust,
And his facial expression's pure lust.
Now he's passed me a note.
I'll react with a vote
Of no confidence—basic distrust.

On your dashboard, a blinking red light
Will alert you that something's not right.
And here is a fact:
If you quickly react
You'll avoid a more dangerous plight.

This here alkalinization is what
Will occur when the pH was not
Very high, but gets raised
Up to eight, Lord be praised.
(Basic chemistry's all that I got.)

Yes, it's feasible, but is it wise
To spend zillions on space? Are the eyes
Of Earth's war-ravaged poor,
Then, not hard to ignore?
Could we possibly answer their cries?

This net used by fisheries kills
By entangling fish by their gills.
It hangs like a wall,
Trapping porpoises, small
Or large turtles, and others it stills.

Every Friday night meal starts with dips
(Spinach, olive, tomato) and chips.
We keep licking the spread
Till we're way overfed.
"Guess I won't serve the meal," Mother quips.

The e-mail has bounced from my blast
To the mailing list I have amassed.
Did each friend of mine change
His address? That is strange!
Don't my pals want to MAKE MONEY FAST!!!!! ?

Encircled by foes on the heath,
Fierce chicken lips threaten beneath.
Flapping buffalo wings
Try to tug his heart strings!
He escapes by the skin of his teeth.

My friends say my wife is a curse:
"Miss America, Chris, in reverse!"
I reply she is gentle
And non-tempermental.
A body could do so much worse.

Their prospectus arrived, proudly stating
That [to translate arcane boilerplating]
I should find it a thrill:
Though not licensed to kill,
Their bonds have the AAA rating.

A bench seat that's part of a car
Is the friendliest set-up, by far,
Both for necking and petting;
It's better, I'm betting,
Than any—ouch!—bucket seats are.

Though embalmment's for some, my advice is:
Don't expect, after death, that the prices
Of the fluid to inject
Will go down. I suspect
That for most a wood coffin suffices.

It's a cute little curtain of rings;
Move your head, and it jingles and sings.
From your basinet pale,
Hang an aventail's mail,
'Cause a sword in the neck really stings.

"Global warming has happened before
And will happen again," quoth the bore,
As he grabbed my arm boldly.
I answered him coldly,
"Obstructionist! Go! Read Al Gore!"

I'm the holder of many degrees,
And my transcript shows all A's and B's.
Ph.D.'s? Listen, I'm
Earning three at a time.
I'm so brainy, I do this with ease.

Lister's theories were spurned vitriolically
By old surgeons, stiff-coated symbolically.
But the phenol he sprayed
Was enough to dissuade
All the bugs, which were conquered carbolically.

Chef Jean-Paul Cauliflower-Florette
Made a mousse from a rat for a bet.
Monsieur Gaston, his boss,
Added hot chocolate sauce
And declared, "Voilà! Parfait du Pet."

Cowabunga! A phrase that conveys
Your excitement, amazement, or praise.
It's a favorite of Bart's
(He's the Simpson who farts),
But it started way back in the days.

For his garden, my friend bought a gnome,
And it speaks of the rules of his home.
It's a maxim and not
Some dumb dwarf that he got:
"Do as Romans do when you're in Rome."

A friar who lived in a friary
Wrote the following note in his diary:
"My new cloak with the hood
Was shredded for good
When I stood in the wood that was briary."

James J. Andrews first hijacked a train
For a search-and-destroy type campaign,
But the Rebels soon caught him.
To prison they brought him,
Where treatment was far from humane.

"Foot it featly, my son. You've ability,
So dance now with graceful agility.
Jack, be nimble tonight.
Since the ladies delight
In a dance, they'll ignore your puerility."

Eating meat, Dee's been overindulgent.
She feels ill; we'll provide an emulgent.
In a really short while
She'll secrete lots of bile.
Then she'll beam with a smile that's effulgent.

It's in vain that the teenagers try
All their algebra skills to apply.
Though they can, on occasions,
Solve x in equations,
They still haven't figured out y.

It's a fack that I might date yer mother
Or, assumin' he's free, yer big brother.
Breaks no squares, no siree.
I ain't picky, y'see.
Six a one, haff a dozen a t'other.

'Twas Daggoo roused the crew just ere noon.
Queequeg sprung and he flung his harpoon.
The whale's flurry then splashed
The whole crew. How it thrashed!
Soaked, Stubb said, "Kill 'im dead—make it soon!"

From our word list, two words I am getting:
Besotting, and also besetting.
One "reason derailing,"
The other "assailing";
You won't mix them up, I am betting.

He's subservient—licks his chief's boot,
And his clientage ought to bear fruit;
But the clienthood he
Lives with wouldn't please me.
The dependency never would suit.

Sister Mary was bald (had no hair).
As she sat in the hairdresser's chair,
She said "Just a short coif,
Will be really enough."
So he tailored a skullcap with care.

Red with rage, I phoned Orange support:
"Yellow there! Look, I'm not the green sort..."
Then I turned the air blue,
With some purple prose, too.
That's my autism spectrum, in short.

Kinetics, if  chemical, tell
Us how long it will take till we smell—
Using noses as testers—
The products, like esters,
Once acid and booze are mixed well.

Use eyebright, you herbalist jerk?
It's a flower, not something from Merck!
It's alternative medicine
Likely to get us in
Trouble — not proven to work.

Good designers, on laser or vid,
Anti-alias lines on a grid.
Run a digital smear
And the jags disappear;
With this lie, ugly truth can be hid.

I'm amychophobic, so natch,
I'll say no to a wrestling match,
To a pinch or a push,
Or a thorn-bearing bush;
I am deathly afraid of a scratch.

She's been irritable, edgy, and tense;
She overreacts; makes no sense;
Any question I pose
About dress-size or nose-
Jobs or menstrual cycles is "dense."

From Rick's tone, I could tell what his rant meant.
He had not understood what my aunt meant.
She had wanted him chained
On their date. He abstained:
"No, enchainment won't lead to enchantment!"

The warrior's blessed and confessed.
He's armored, yet feels under-dressed.
Though mailed, he's afraid,
For his cuirie's mislaid —
That's the hard leather shield for his breast.

Bill's a bobby — a bold 'boy in blue';
Joined the force in two-thousand-and-two.
Since that day, Bill Macmillan's
Caught hundreds of villains
And he wields a mean billiard cue.

The professor who spoke on geology
Owes his students an abject apology.
What he gave as a speech
Called Why Sand Coats the Beach
Was a mass of confusing cacology.

A student of astrolithology
Had a vice he would never acknowledge: he
Would go out at night
With a meteorite...
(I can't bear to say more; my apology.)

What to say when Hawaiians go by,
When aloha's "hello" and "goodbye"?
Don't you worry, 'cause they
Will respond either way;
The distinction just doesn't apply.

Keep 'em up! (Not your down-in-the-gutter kick)
Keep it smooth! (No more stammer-and-stutter kick)
Flap those stiff wooden pegs!
Swimmer's freestyling legs
Should move fluently, dude. Do the flutter kick!

They said my accounting was splendid,
But told me my contract had ended.
So why was I sacked?
My report showed they lacked
Enough cash—they were overextended.

"Mona Lisa's strange smile," said my teacher,
"Results from no brows, a key feature —
That's DaVinci's disgrace!"
When I eyebrowed her face,
A wide grin took its place: happy creature!

I'm a blimp, I'm a sphere, I'm obese.
Ambulation will likely soon cease,
Since I'm hobbling — I'm lame —
It's my weight that's to blame
For my limping.  More pie please, a piece.

Compensative pride? Her life scheme
Is to live out a movie-star dream.
She extols her own roles
And looks down on the proles
To make up for her low self-esteem.

"This limerick is brilliant! What's more,
All the editors think it's top drawer.
When we publish your gem
We've decided we're cutting Line 4."

The last day of the championship race:
The team that United would face
Was their great rival, City.
The match, tough and gritty
Would enthrall every fan in the place.

Full this cloth; neither wail nor beseech.
Pour the liquid; you do it, I'll teach.
Never mind the foul smell,
Press it down, soak it well;
Given time the hot urine will bleach.

A pedantic neologist (charmless)
Who was sheveled and kempt said, "If armless
Means without any arms,
And if I'm without barms,
Well then, I must be sane: I am barmless!"

The judge was so angry, he preached
That the law of the land had been breached.
The butt of his fury?
A runaway jury—
A compromise verdict was reached.

Of this airplane Ms Bligh is the buyer.
She's a trained and experienced flier
Who claims she's a pilot
Who can glide through an eyelet.
(Her self-confidence couldn't fly higher.)

Me?  Revise?  Well, I don't mean to boast,
But I don't work that hard; I just coast.
I can learn things with ease
And exams are a breeze.
Half an hour I will study, at most.

Conjoined twins, Zev and Aaron, to me
Were the luckiest babes there could be.
Every doctor agrees
They were parted with ease.
They'd been joined at the foreskin, you see.

Despite fear of failure, man's driven
To look for a mate—that's a given.
In terms of romance, he
Agrees that it's chancy,
But what the hell, life is for livin'!

"This is one of those well-meaning plays
That makes adequate use of clichés.
Of the tunes, some are bright,
And the dancing's alright."
This review damns our show with faint praise.

An example of expatriation
Will serve as that word's explanation:
"An Azerbaijani
Becomes an Irani."
As you've gathered by now, it's migration.

The broadcast you heard on art deco,
Or flamenco as danced by J. Greco—
Signals all bounced to ground
Off a satellite round:
A balloon, and the first one was Echo.

When they make it, a flea collar's soaked
In insecticide. Jim's sister joked:
"Flea-bag bro' can wear that.
It's too big for the cat!"
You can guess the response that provoked!

Chronogrammatists exercise wit.
Their inscriptions are cunningly writ:
Clever wording will hide
A date written inside.
I respect their technique quite a bit.

A tightrope performer named Jenny
Said, "Nets? I refuse to use any."
But, making a wave,
She tumbled and gave
One breathless performance too many.

Coyotes and canines can breed,
And their offspring, the coydog, will feed
On the lamb and the hen,
Isn't fearful of men,
And is cunning enough to succeed.

Adjusted gross income?  Relax!
Just sit down and I'll give you the facts.
From your annual pay,
Take deductions away,
And on the remainder, pay tax.

Take a big geologic event,
As when most of the dinosaurs went;
Well, that asteroid strike
Marked a true golden spike,
A clear sign that an era was spent.

Once they'd speak of a shrew, I am told,
In the wonderfully quaint days of old,
As a hag or old bag;
When a woman would nag:
"She's a chidester; the woman's a scold."

Think a scholar just sits on his ass
Taking entrance tests hoping to pass?
There is stiff competition
For free rides on tuition
For an angler who's great catching bass.

In tufts and in clumps and in bunches,
These grasses are animals' lunches.
A perennial plant
Like the bunchgrass just can't
Wait for snowfall, when nobody munches.

As a bride, you're a slouch in the sack
If your Sacrum is all out of whack;
That chakra, my daughter,
Is meant to be water,
And oughta be orange, not black!

"Coarse-grained igneous rock for you, Janet!"
"But that's common—all over the planet!
Now I'm all out of sorts
From this feldspar and quartz!"
My gift failed, 'cause she took it for granite.

They're so many, we don't even try
To count all the stars in the sky.
And every one sprang
From a single big bang
(Like you, dearest reader, and I).

Your additions are not worth a song;
Explanations so utterly wrong
They are only pathetical,
Epexegetical
Nonsense (and also too long).

The thunderstorm boomed; what a sound!
And the boom of our boat swung around.
Then the Coast Guard arrived
Making sure we survived—
When the boom we'd hit ran us aground.

Good King Wenceslas, long, long ago,
Ordered pizza (for warmth in the snow)
Deep pan, crisp and even,
That Feast of St. Stephen —
A fact few historians know!

When a bus chose one day to invade
My front lawn, here's the claim that I laid:
Distress damage feasant.
Though cattle it isn't,
Compensation thus had to be paid.

I lie in agrostis alone.
Among these tall grasses I'm prone.
  My love is sincere,
  But if you won't come near,
Lend an ear and I'll fashion a clone.

The nudist considers it wise
To expose what we wish he'd aguise.
But as well as our skins,
There may be certain sins
That a loose-fitting outfit belies.

Shoppers searching for alcohol find
Some that's labeled denatured—the kind
That, along with the ethanol,
Has poisons like methanol.
Those who drink it get sick or go blind.

What is endmost in each line you see
Of this verse is the same, you'll agree.
You will carefully note,
If you see how it's wrote,
That the letter each ends with is "e."

Done the trick was once quite untoward,
As its meanings were not in accord:
There was (1) "(Up) You've won!",
And too (2) "(Down) You're done!".
Cleft like cleave, 'twas a double-edged sword.

While applying to borrow a few,
You're awaiting your bankers' review.
Since you'll surely repay,
They should grant their okay,
Giving credit where credit seems due.

Appraise this brief verse as you will,
There are others yet briefer; but still,
When it comes to haiku,
I'm unsure what to do,
So I'll limerick 'til I've had my fill.

British soldiers may be in a mess
When they're far from home—no one can guess.
But apart from some booze
They've got music and news,
Which is broadcast by BFBS.

"Funny jokes are not all that's required,"
Said the boss to the comic he hired.
"It is how they are told
That will knock 'em out cold.
Your delivery sucks, so you're fired!"

'Twas a breach of good manners to broach
The inheritance; that would encroach
On the process of mourning;
She was given fair warning,
But her greed overrode all reproach.

I have ordered a precious brocade
In which flowers of gold form a braid,
But my damassin's late.
Bet my damn ass it's fate
That my damask de luxe is delayed.

My devotion, yer craved. Love, I gave yer,
But yer mother I am, not yer slave. Yer
Refrain, "Look at me!
LOOK AT ME!" I now see
Is attention ("MUM!") seeking behaviour.

When I'm making up poetry, fashion'll
Often govern the form, although passion'll
Take over my pen;
So I've got to quit when
What I'm writing becomes antirational.

The strip Crankshaft is funny enough,
But it isn't just meaningless fluff.
You might reach for the tissues
When it's dealing with issues
That show how one's life can be tough.

Never broil a brown blucher 'til blue.
It's no trout, after all — it's a shoe —
A half boot, if you please,
And it fits one with ease,
Who appears thereupon well-to-do.

Bea's a gal on her own—that's no flaw.
She is not in the care of her paw,
Or a husband, or brother,
Or significant other.
Her discoverture's there in the law.

Different crate sizes used to constrain a port
In turnover terms. A containerport
Has a standard container
For ships—a no-brainer.
And that, friends, is how you explain a port.

My stomach just started to swell.
It was caused by a single sperm cell.
What had started as fun
Became known as my son;
But at any rate all ended well.

An anacoluthon — I'll show
What this means. When you start with — although,
Just as soon as you reach —
(Less in writing than speech) —
With a different sentence, you know?

If you want to date someone like me,
Your new car must be something to see.
You must have a fine residence
And lots of dead presidents
To spend. You don't get me for free!

I said, "'Yellowish alloy of copper
And zinc' is distinctly a proper
Description of brass,"
In my lame, brazen pass
At the radiant light fixture shopper.

Archizoic, I learned from my teachers,
Refers to the earliest creatures.
Some had only one cell,
But they did very well
With so few anatomical features.

In La Brea, a tar pit formation
Snared dinosaurs unto starvation.
What's left is their bones —
Now they're fossils, like stones,
And the rest of them's trapped, in tarnation.

I play saxophone (after a fashion),
Though my work all the critics are trashin'.
Still they have to admire
That I play with great fire:
Intensity, vigor, and passion.

I was offered a "donative gift"
With no shred of linguistical thrift.
Tautological forms
Are now marketing norms,
So I'm flattered, but equally miffed.

Acquitting defendants is tough
When evidence shows that they're rough.
But if you find out
There's good reason to doubt,
For acquittal, that's more than enough.

Ethidium bromide's a stain
That with DNA tends to enchain.
One nice trait it possesses:
It coolly fluoresces.
Ask a lab wonk why that is germane.

He's inventive beyond comprehension;
Every outfit sings out for attention.
His choice in costumery's
Brilliant with humor; he's
Broken the bonds of convention.

At the start of the show Breaking Bad,
Walter White's a kind teacher and dad,
But things really get messy
When he hooks up with Jesse
And New Mexico's drug lords get mad.

A driver need not be a thinker
To indicate turns with a blinker.
A nitwit can learn
How to signal a turn:
Just maneuver the lever, you stinker.

I don't care what Miss Poppins has said
About treating a cold in the head!
With a cupful of sugar,
It would still taste like booger.
I think I'd be better off dead!

A bung is a plug, seal or stopper.
It could be quite small, or a whopper;
May be yielding or tough,
Made of various stuff
Such as cork, perhaps wood, even copper.

He knows not his left from his right;
Besides, he's extremely uptight.
With our wedding soon due,
He'll make his debut,
So we're starting dance lessons tonight.

It's agreed, as the norm, as three years
For the timeframe when Jesus drew cheers.
But a bipaschal scheme,
To a few, it would seem,
Fits in "baptized" to Calvary's tears.

Call me childlike — I won't feel defiled,
Or deny that my spirit is wild.
The excitable boy
In my soul brings me joy,
For I see through the eyes of this child.

Said a trustworthy media source:
"In the whole monthly budget, the force
Gets twelve thousand bucks flat,
And a good bit of that
Goes for coffee and doughnuts, of course."

My spoonerist friends all maintain
I'm Keen Jelly.  I cannot complain.
Falling off the Pont Neuf
In my cups left me perf-
ectly wringing, it's true, in the Seine.

Our lecturer blamed the abstruseness
Of the book on its patent diffuseness.
But I'm onto his game—
And the author, the same:
I suspect it was just their obtuseness.

He was Chapman, then later became
"Johnny Appleseed". Planting, his game,
Put trees 'cross the land;
Seeds sown from his hand
Gave to Johnny his great claim to fame.

Steve is worse than a baby who's teething.
When annoyed, he gets angry; he's seething.
He turns red, seems to choke,
Like he's having a stroke.
He's dyspneic, with loud, labored breathing.

In the Amazon, hunting your quarry,
Using blowgun darts tipped with curare,
If your tribesman gets nailed
When you've coughed or exhaled,
You should clearly say, "Oops, awful sorry!"

Dad and son, farmers both, took a walk.
Warned the Dad, "Asked for secrets, just balk.
No loose lips!  Farms have spies:
Corn has ears, spuds have eyes,
And what grows on a beanstalk — beans — talk."

Urban summers, so hot, got you stewing?
Find a spot that is cool for canoeing.
Paddle straighter and faster
If the J-stroke you'll master;
Bow or stern, seek your spirit's renewing.

Though all day we've been crouching in ditches,
With dogtags and ammo and itches,
We cannot afford
To get careless or bored,
Or our aidman will have us in stitches.

I'm still young, yet my spine's out of whack.
My damn duty belt's killing my back.
It holds gear that I need
On the job to succeed,
Right at hand if the bad guys attack.

The brow is a part of the face
That can frown upon one in disgrace.
By extension, it's said
That a cliff's craggy head
Is seen beetling over its base.

Now, I know the earth's flat and not round:
I'd fall off if my grip were unsound.
To less flimsily cling
For dear life to the thing,
I've nailed both of my feet to the ground.

An inveterate felon named Mel
Is rather like Strep—how? I'll tell:
While one is a worm
And the other's a germ,
Still they both are confined to one cell.

We have now reached the welcome position
Where, in broadcasting, we've the addition
Of the cybercast—views,
Entertainment and news
On an internet-hosted transmission.

Consider the casebearer moth:
Its larva's not noted for sloth,
Busy building a case
Out of silk fringed with lace—
But come next year, it's dressing up Goth.

When I spied him soaped up in my shower,
I timidly chose just to cower.
I knew I should caulk
To keep out this auk,
But stood frozen for over an hour.

"They went that-a-way!" Pepe told Pete.
And Pete growled as they rolled down the street.
"It's not just their loss
That is making me cross —
It's your vile anaptyctic deceit."

My knowledge is all unimpeachable.
It is docible — totally reachable;
I've college degrees
And I'm learning Chinese,
The bassoon, birds and bees — I'm so teachable!

An advice columnist? What could that be?
Is the writer a he or a she?
When I write, "My heart aches!"
And they help me, it makes
Not a damn bit of difference to me.

She's a brig, has two masts and square sails,
Great for cargo, or hunting for whales.
While it takes expertise
Sailing into a breeze,
The skill of the captain prevails.

Take a crystalline ketone: acet-
ophenone. Add some esters.  Complete!
Smells like almond, or berry,
Or jasmine, or cherry.
These resins make perfume so sweet.

I was dizzy. The cause seemed exotic:
A virus infection, entotic
(Inside of my ear).
Couldn't balance or hear,
Or be helped by an antibiotic.

An alienist, Dr. Bob Lyle,
Was consulted in many a trial.
He affirmed mental fitness
Of defendant and witness,
But a guy like E. T.? Not his style.

Today's anthropologist traces
"Indigenous" customs and places.
Before, agriology
(Sans an apology)
Studied "uncivilized" races.

"I'm preparing a large data entry
And concerned that our firm's data sentry
Won't protect it from harm,"
Cried the Yank with alarm.
"Data centre, dear twit—elementary!"

Alvin Toffler, who wrote Future Shock,
Called decisions arrived at ad hoc
(An arrangement that he
Christened adhocracy)
More efficient than punching the clock.

A role model, always reliable,
John was one of our best, exemplifiable,
Till he came into work
With that gun — went berserk!
That he'd changed overnight's undeniable.

For I've thought thee so fair, and so bright,
Who art dark as is hell, as is night.
In a sonnet, some Briton
As its couplet had written.
Ah, not quite...though today he well might.

Through frustration that will not abate,
I am in an expostulatory state —
I argue the toss,
Reason well with my boss,
To let me take control of my fate.

Though his S.A.T. scores all had caved,
Your son's path to the Ivies was paved.
It'll cost you X grand
To admit.  It's the land
Of the "G" and the home of the waived.

If you're tempted to eavesdrop, my dear,
Through a half-open door, then I fear
If the chat's about you
On the day that you do,
Be prepared to not like what you hear!

Let me here give a shout-out and nod
To the king of all fish:  the black cod.
This sablefish, found
All around Puget Sound,
Tastes oh-so-much better than scrod.

Here's a word that is mighty, yet small—
Does a service beyond duty's call.
Look and see: a, l, l;
Only three letters spell
What can signify anything 't all.

The First Family's the president's kin.
I have heard, to the staff's great chagrin,
In the White House guests saw
Someone's mother-in-law
Boldly badger a POTUS therein.

Can you tell me why day turns to night
And a wandering ten-year-old might
Grow up stay-at-home-y? E-
nantiodromia?
Growth into opposites? Right.

Cuboidal cells—seen, on reflection,
As layers of the body's protection—
Are in kidneys and eyes,
And the testes of guys.
I've always viewed mine with affection.

Be proactive, man; trouble's ahead.
Wait too long, the thing's likely to spread.
If you get out in front of it,
You won't bear the brunt of it.
(I'll deny every word I've just said.)

Since the waiter was hairless: "Hey, Baldy!"
He came but seemed less than enthralled. He
Brought coffee, quite hot,
But his aim?  It was not!
And I left the place dripping and scaldy.

A crimeful young tootsie named Mons
Said, "I often would blackmail my johns:
'I'll ring up your honey
If I don't get  more money.'"

That inside a solution will go.
Whether liquid or gas
It will hide all its mass
Within something like pure H2O.

A troublesome jackanapes, Clarence,
Had lax and indulgent-ish parents.
Accepting such aesture
Was once called digesture:
Unwarranted brooking, forbearance.

My father departed this life
Long ago. (No more trouble and strife,
Of which he'd had plenty.)
At the age of just twenty
He cut short his days with a knife.

As some foolhardy bathers have learnt,
Do not swim in the Benguela Current.
From Antarctica's coast
To Angola's shores, most
Of those in for a dip wish they weren't.

"Cryoproteins? They're proteins," said Heather,
"That, when chilled, end up sticking together.
I'll provide just one sample:
Cryoglobulin—ample
Amounts lead to pain in cold weather."

Barefoot pilgrim's a slang term for folk
Who, through foolish investments, go broke.
They lose all of their dough
Buying high, selling low.
And their status on Wall Street?  A joke.

Although it may not be intentional,
To possess just one heart is conventional.
The Doctor is blessed
With two hearts in his chest,
But then he has the space, n-dimensional.

The talk show had scheduled a date
With the author, an object of hate.
He arrived at the show
To a warm, rosy glow:
'Twas a book burning, not a debate.

A fruit-loving fellow from Guam
Loved balaustine desserts (made of pom-
egranate, whose flowers
Have medicinal powers
When dried, as a tea or a balm).

The neighbors are all in a buzz
Since police have arrested my cuz.
While she does have short hair,
It's not right to declare
That my cuz has been snatched by the fuzz.

Pretty plastering? Bruce disapproves.
His complaint is the comb-work, the grooves.
"It's a classier look?
Not in this fella's book:
Collects dirt." So he packs up and moves.

Said the Empress, "These limericks, I fear,
Make me wonder why I persevere.
Does this guy write and parse
With his thumb up his arse?
For there's no ars poetica here."

"I avoid any over-reliance,
As to me it is just an appliance,
While to you it's a buddy
And subject of study—
Computers, for you, are a science."

Said David, "I hate to be snide,
But treason I cannot abide."
"Peace, peace, son of Jesse,
Betrayal is messy,"
Amasai said, "We're on your side."

Our coagency's easily shown;
The deities can't work alone —
There's no god of the skies
Who can make the sun rise,
If on earth he's completely unknown.

This limerick's not one of my best
There are some problems that must be adressed.
They are fixable, though,
And I want you to know
Perfect writing's forever my quest.

Force of law that a custom gets, gratis,
Then constitutes consuetude status.
We're kind to our neighbors
Lest miffed neighbors' labors
Fling onerous rules right back at us.

Extraord- (that's 'outside' more than 'more')
Plus inarily (adverb, for sure)
Has a length that's unseemly;
I'll stick to extremely
When something fantastic's in store.

Ever pitched in the land of Sri Lanka.
I'm not British, so I'm
Here to say they both rhyme
With that wonderful film Casablanca.

When faced with his wife's retribution,
Cheating hubby pursued restitution:
"We'll solve this!  Just stay!"
But, while walking away,
She said, "No.  I prefer dissolution."

Ecologically sound, the whole lot:
Greens grown on my own little plot!
But you hesitate; why? Oh,
Fear not, it's a bio-
degradable slug that you've got.

I decided my Porsche was a jumper...
Jumped a fence, hit the ditch, bent a bumper.
I was going so fast
That that bump was her last.
She's imperfect, so now I must dump her.

Country House wins the Derby? Unfair!
Max Security won—room to spare.
But that steed was disqualified.
His fans booed; weren't mollified.
Fair is foul. Foul is fair. Bettors care.

Sighed the reader, "I don't care a bit
For the digitization of lit;
And as analog books
Yield to Kindles, it looks
Like it's time to start learning to knit."

There's a story that's certain to please,
Drenched in sun, often tossed in the breeze.
Though over already,
Its heights are quite heady:
Emergents, the tallest of trees.

Bathybius: thought for a time
As life's source, a primordial slime.
Huxley pled to a goof,
Once convinced by the proof
That his slime was far short of sublime.

After winning a horse-race trifecta,
Our exec made a fete, and it wrecked a
Fine diet. The mounds
Of rich food put on pounds—
And I only consumed analecta!

Pre-gorilla and pre-chimpanzee,
From the Miocene stage
To the Pliocene age,
Was mother of them, you and me.

With my beggarly life in the slum,
I subsist on old bread and used gum.
 Yet I donate at church,
 Lest my name they besmirch
(Even though it's a beggarly sum).

It's an entity likely to draw,
From the masses, misgivings and awe.
Body corporate's the term
For a business or firm
That can act as a person by law.

ill skip punctuation without it

would help to convey
what im trying to say

He asked her, "Will you be my baby?"
"Quite possibly, yes!"
Was her answer.  His guess
Was correct: "That's a definite maybe!"

Peers and nobs? — we're much better than them.
Bow and show us your loyalty,
We're practically royalty —
The bloom at the top of the stem.

The aorta's the common location
For narrowing called coarctation
Which surgeons repair,
If they dare, with great care
In the kids with this strange aberration.

As a morpheme, the letters "-E-D"
Have a difference you'll hear but won't see.
Hunted, fixed, and esteemed
Are linguistically deemed
Allomorphic, in past tense, all three!

"There's a crane in the sky!" cry my sons,
And my youngest is scared, so he runs.
That's the wise thing to do
If one's headed towards you.
Such equipment can weigh fifteen tons.

A nautical lassie of leisure
Had a bathing suit sewn for her pleasure.
An X marked the spot
Where the swimwear felt hot,
To guide pirates who plundered her treasure.

All those dance bands of old used to thrill a
Broad swathe of the public, but will a
Resurgence of these
Be a tuneful reprise
If not led by the likes of Glenn Miller?

There's this princess so delicate she
Loses sleep on account of a pea
'Neath her mattress. By gosh,
It would take twenty squash
To discomfit a fellow like me.

"It's karate your children should learn,"
Says my buddy, a black belt named Verne.
"Martial arts may be key,
But the classes ain't free,"
Counters me (with no money to burn).

I'll define alpargata with skill:
It's what some people call espadrille.
It's a light canvas shoe
With a rope sole that you
May find worn in the Pyrenees still.

Tonight I shall grub in the pub,
Maybe pub grub, and hopefully, chub.
This colloquial word
Is most frequently heard,
Amongst folk who mean food, but say grub.

Despite pleas, legal process won't stop,
And tomorrow your body should drop—
As a crack-halter, though,
You're a failure. I know,
'Cause you made an identity swap!

Anadama bread rules our small roost.
Mom thinks it's a nutrient boost.
We go off to classes
Chock full of molasses—
Strong scholars that Mom has produced.

I'm asleep, so I don't really feel 'im,
When the surgeon incises my celom,
Cuts my stomach and gut,
Sews them up again, but
Now it's up to my body to heal 'em.

Some towns may be sprawling and gritty,
But Durham is compact and pretty.
Perched high o'er the Wear,
The cathedral, it's clear,
Is the jewel at the heart of this city.

Pierre's Rock In The River review:
"...I was paddling the flooded canoe;
Still, the water poured in
Through the hole in its skin —
Till I gurgled and spluttered adieu..."

Here at Gooloogong primary school
We've one single traditional rule:
Each clique's youngest we call
The group's chippy. That's all.
(Aussies love slang that's simple, but cruel.)

My wife said, "I'm lacking in flair.
I want Jennifer Aniston's hair."
I replied, "If you want
A celeb look to flaunt,
Go for Pamela Anderson's pair!"

In this furnace, an air blast removes
Imperfections; the ore it improves.
As slag floats to the top,
Molten metal will drop
To be cast into pigs without hooves.

A fringe movement surfaced one day
On the "right of the right", you might say.
These net-smart alt-right folks
Aggrandize just white folks;
All others? They ain't as OK.

An eight-legged spider said, "Geez!
(And my six-legged friend here agrees.)
We find it so comic
That parts anatomic
Are singles and pairs, never threes."

A specific sub-species of bloke
Was a -gory: a -gill or a -gloak.
(James H. Vaux, who loved spinnin' 'em,
Says it's their synonym:
English, mate, as she were spoke.)

"Sit besides your poor terminal aunt,"
Said my father. I answered, "I can't.
What you mean is beside."
Then her eyes opened wide:
"Screw the grammar and spare me your rant!"

To explore in large ships was proved daft.
Lighter ships were the key.  Shallow draft
Let them sail close to shore,
Search new rivers and more.
Nimble caravels — class of these craft.

Every night down at one of the pubs,
Jake is putting his dukes up.  He drubs
All the card-cutting fools
Who don't play by his rules.
You see, Jake always shows deuce of clubs.

The economists' pleas have been heeded
That accounting in period's needed
In uniform sizes
So there won't be surprises,
And that forecasts aren't falsely exceeded.

The braiding that graces your hair
Makes curious folk stop and stare,
Since you chose not your head
But your nose hair, instead,
As the place for your hair-weaving flair!

A woman who's called a coquette
Exudes sexual promise, and yet
Despite her sweet smiles,
And her feminine wiles,
She gives only for what she can get.

To ensure that your work is precise.
You can fish out the truth
When you act like a sleuth.
Be attentive and thorough; think twice.

Go the media's climate-change scares—
As though nobody knew!
As to whether they're true,
As per usual, nobody cares.

It's a burdensome job, not a perk—
Very hard, but I simply won't shirk.
I've been given a task,
And I'll do it—I'll bask
As I test if this sunscreen will work.

If ever you find you're in doubt
Of the blood gas dissolved thereabout—
CO2 and O2
In one's plasma—then you
Run a blood gas (a test to find out).

The court of last resort's where you go
If in courts lower down they've said, "No,
Our judgement's not for you."
But others implore you:
"Keep fighting — we're here for you, bro!"

Here's a myth that is hard to ignore:
An old scientist used to get sore.
As Copernicus named,
Copper knickers he blamed.
(The tough underwear garment he wore).

All the students were locked in his stare.
Their soiled souls needed cleansing and care.
One dumb boor acted crass;
Raised a cheek and passed gas.
How much grief should a poor yogi bear?

As a force lies in wait in Belize,
A few soldiers are strolling, at ease.
Into danger they stray
Down a narrow allée,
'Cause they can't see the force for the trees.

Though some time may remain,
We're eventually going to seed.

"Is a job I can do on my own
With this four-foot-long float
Called a darby. Please note
That this wall hides your brother's trombone."

With a moderate distance to go.
He's of medium height
And his weight is just right—
Not a star but your typical Joe.

"For the love of God!"  That's what I say
When I vent my frustration.  That way,
It's an oath that's OK,
That won't turn folks away —
Tends to end stupid games people play.

Look, you're botching that étude, you see,
'Cause your fingers aren't where they should be.
You just can't play the song
If your fingering's wrong.
Get it right, or give up Debussy.

Their romancing and courtship were heady,
But marriage? I doubt that they're ready.
He stays out when he wishes,
Neither one does the dishes,
And her cakes, when she bakes them, are bready.

"The conductive adhesive I chose
Is the kind having current that flows
In a single direction.
I'd call my selection,
Well, anisotropic!" he crows.

It's not arthrogryposis you've got."

"My joints were contracted
At birth, so please cease talking rot."

Black medic's a clover-like weed.
Its flowers are yellow; the seed
Is small, black, and round.

Though no doctor, it helps your soil feed.

Quite safe to accept what she deemed
A very kind offer
And most gracious proffer:
A ride home in his Bentley; she beamed.

I arrive in Brazil.  I am broke; a
Guy in Rio—he offers a smoke, a
Few réis, advice:
On the beach you'll find nice
Wealthy ladies. A true Carioca!

I am studying medical facts.
Hit a tendon—its muscle contracts.
Such a tap makes your knee flex.
It's called a deep reflex—
And thus normal muscle reacts.

Screw-in-lightbulb jokes only have zing
Where the Edison screw mount is king.
Where quick changing's what counts,
Plug in bayonet mounts
With two prongs, L-shaped slots and a spring.

My children got under my skin
With their messes.  My patience wore thin
With my blood pressure high.
They're still slobs.  Now I try
Meditation, deep breathing, and gin.

You've seen willows that seem to be weeping,
And employed willow brooms when you're sweeping,
But for ground cover, try
Salix repens. Here's why:
It is reptant—this willow is creeping.

Towns are carpet-bombed. Planes overhead
Aim to cause devastation widespread.
Though I've not heard a boom,
Did a bomb hit Rick's room?
The floor's buried, with no space to tread.

It's important to grow, make a move.
A new bag's what you need;
You were stuck, now you're freed!
Get a move on, you've something to prove.

I want women in charge: gynecocracy!
Because gynarchy beats our democracy,
Even though I'm a big
Dumb male chauvinist pig.
Is this irony, cant or hypocrisy?

Once again, you have do-not-come-near breath.
It's a smell-that-puts-into-me-fear breath.
You've downed brewskies all night;
They reversed. Is that right?
I'm not kissing your vomit-and-beer breath!

I was nursing my Scotch on the rocks
When this babe saunters up—a real fox.
Face and figure? Sublime!
She sits down and says, "I'm
Boanthropic. I think I'm an ox."

Great Babylon's king loosed the truss
On Jehoiachin; made quite a fuss.
But Evil-Merodach,
Named so like a toad—ack!—
Can't quite be seen kindly by us.

To his dwindling supply, "What a grind.
I'm more or less broke,
And have less and less smoke,
Yet I'm more and more Cheetos-inclined!"

I'm okay, but I make no pretense
That my chessplaying skills are immense.
My opponent drew white
And then moved his queen's knight.
It appears I'll be playing defense.

I really don't wanna sound sharp,
But you say that you don't know Jean Arp?
He was active in Dada,
A sculptor... still nada?
Your pa keep you under a tarp?

With gray plumage, red legs, and red bill,
The chukar in flight brings a thrill.
It's imported for sport,
Although some might retort
That it's really too pretty to kill.

Dear fans, re the letters you write:
Peace and love, but I'm losing the fight.
From October, I'm sure,
They'll be answered no more:
I've no time. Peace and love, and goodnight.

If your bladder's atonic, your doc
Might prescribe neostigmine to block
Cholinesterase: stuff
Causing pee leaks and tough
To inhibit when drugs aren't in stock.

An old chestnut popped into my head:
"Two bishops were lying in bed.
Which one, do you think,
Wore the nightie?" (nudge, wink)
"Mrs Bishop, of course," someone said.

I trip o'er ecthlipsis. My lips
Lisp limply. This term, in eclipse,
Meant elision of -um,
As in this rule of numb —
"Opi' eases the tedi' on ships."

Young Christina disputed a call.
Her opponent stood bouncing the ball.
The crowd booed disbelief,
As the ump gave her grief—
Once again they were tied, 40–all.

It's likely I'm drunk now — befuddled
And buzzed as a bee, my brain muddled.
For six hours on my ass,
I sat watching this glass
Between counter and mouth being shuttled.

How did mom scare me out of joining the X-treme Harley Acrobats Team?
