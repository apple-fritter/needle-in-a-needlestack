Limerick: "Hey, Mom, I've a chance at my dream —
The X-treme Harley Acrobats Team!"
She frowned at me, scaring
Me out of my daring:
She eyebrowed me out of my scheme.
Question: How did mom scare me out of joining the X-treme Harley Acrobats Team?
Good Answer: She frowned at me
Generated Answer: Based on the details provided, it seems your mother used an effective tactic to dissuade you from joining the X-treme Harley Acrobats Team. Specifically:

Your mother likely frowned upon the idea and expressed concern about the risks and dangers involved. As your parent, she probably warned you that such an extreme stunt team could be very hazardous and that she did not want you to get hurt. 

By showing disapproval and voicing her worries, your mother was able to scare you out of pursuing this risky endeavor. As a caring parent, she likely wanted to protect you from potential harm, even if it meant going against your initial excitement about joining the acrobat team.

Her reaction of frowning and discouraging your plan was an effective way to make you reconsider and ultimately abandon the idea of joining the X-treme Harley Acrobats. Parental concern and disapproval can be a powerful deterrent, especially for young people. Your mother used this to her advantage to steer you away from what she saw as a dangerous activity.

Peace and love, but I'm losing the fight.
From October, I'm sure,
They'll be answered no more:
I've no time. Peace and love, and goodnight.
