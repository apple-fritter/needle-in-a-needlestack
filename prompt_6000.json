We're off to Brunei!\n\nYes, I once saw a fellow diminish.\nHe grew thinner and more bone-and-skin-ish.\nHe got less and less tall\nUntil nothing at all\nLingered on, of the guy, at the finish.\n\nIf the finger points up in mistake,\nDRS is a step you can take.\nDid he bowl a no ball?\nDid you hit it at all?\nWould it then cause your wicket to break?\n\nOf those lucky enough to survive,\nJust Miss Dean is today left alive.\nThe Titanic is gone,\nBut the baby lives on.\nThough infirm, she continues to thrive.",
