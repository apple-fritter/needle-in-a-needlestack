William Shakespeare wrote many a sonnet
About maids who abandoned the bonnet;
Tresses tossed in the breeze
Made him weak at the knees
With the urge, and the acting upon it.

If you live off the land, life is cruel
In the southwest U.S., but a jewel
Of a plant, I'm assured,
Is the buffalo gourd,
As its seeds yield an oil good for fuel.

Position your cursor and click:
Voila! There are items to pick.
It's a down-dropping menu—
In 2010, you
Should know this already, you hick!

Dear fans, re the letters you write:
Peace and love, but I'm losing the fight.
From October, I'm sure,
They'll be answered no more:
I've no time. Peace and love, and goodnight.

The apron is not where they race,
Nor the spot with repairs taking place.
On a racetrack it's seen
As what's found in between,
An important transitional space.

I accept this is not quite the norm;
I don't care if it's cold or it's warm.
In one state you can't seize me;
Allotropy frees me
To be in far more than one form.

Our pastor says I've a subliminal
Unconscious desire to be criminal,
So I pray night and day
To keep Satan away
And I bray out the hymns from our hymn-i-nal.

They are anthropophilic: they eat
Any people they happen to meet.
We're not all that they chew;
They'll eat other things, too,
But think we are the tastiest treat.

"Since the first day I saw you," said he,
"You're just lovely—so clever, so free!"
But I (thanks to mother)
Knew one line from another.
"That banana oil won't work on me!"

"So, what is a fly loft," you say?
"A loft where freed flies fly away?"
"No, it's just what one calls
The high grid-bearing walls
Holding backdrops and props in a play."

Disencumbrance: an obsolete word
Which folks may have seen, but not heard.
It describes the removal
(And not the approval)
Of burdensome stuff. Not absurd.

Dear folks,
                  Since I'm feeling rah-rahsome,
A bouquet just to say that you're awesome.
You remind me (wrote Alix)
Of a flower's green calyx:
You sheltered the bud, brace the blossom.

We all long to belong, so do you
Have a fam'ly, a country? A clue:
What will hold all together
Is dependent on whether
You've got ties to the others—love's glue.

Make this lens and you'll not only pass,
You will rise to the top of the class.
It must never diffuse
Long-wave reds from short blues.
Hint: You might want to check out crown glass.

This occurs when our government tries
To dress facts in deceptive disguise:
A credibility gap
Means they're feeding us crap,
And the truth is, we're sick of those lies.

The asp was evicted for pissin'
All over his place.  He said, "Listen,
I'm just a poor snake
Who cannot catch a break—
Not even a small pit to hiss in."

Without enough water to drink,
We soon find it harder to think,
As our brains shrivel up.
So let's guzzle each cup,
Lest our cortices rapidly shrink.

I just learned this new fact. I'll expound:
Turns out ground water's never been ground
Like with coffee or beef.
It is really, in brief,
Normal water in aquifers found.

For herbivorous beasts called gelada,
Ethiopia's home, not Nevada.
These are monkeys — robust,
With a rock-climbing lust.
And you've not seen one yet? You've just gotta.

Paper dolls are quite easy, you know.
Fold the paper, then cut. Just go slow.
Any amateur who
Has some scissors will do.
Cutting diamonds, of course, takes a pro.

Please forgive me, for I do not know
How to say the name Vincent van Gogh.
Does the name rhyme with cough,
That elusive van Gogh,
Or with block? Give your answer below.

The arachnid sits down right beside her
In hopes she'll allow him to guide her.
Will this slick cobweb weaver
Seduce and deceive her?
Who knows? He's a comb-footed spider!

When my chemist approached me, I laughed
As he offered an ominous draught.
With this apozem nigh,
He enjoined me to try
A decoction decidedly daft.

"A dichloride is sometimes a salt.
It has two chlorine atoms," said Walt,
"And it may be organic,
Or not; but don't panic.
For the differences, Nature's at fault."

Is this structure a fence or a wall?
Both are flat, both divide, both are tall.
Look far down, Buttercup,
At what holds the thing up.
For a fence, no foundation at all.

On occasion they'll charge a small fee,
But quite often a day pass is free.
At a brewer's guest hall
Without cost, quaff it all.
(Moderation should govern the spree.)

"'Ere, Nobby, just 'and me the gear,"
Says Pilfering Sid in me ear,
So I gives 'im the cutters,
An' now the bloke mutters,
"This bolt is 'ard work… somefink's queer."

Did it equalize odds, make things even?
 No, your Colt didn't help, and you're leavin'
 This earth 'cause he drew
His Colt faster than you.
 Your slow draw means your widow's a-grievin'.

Oh, don't throw your toys out your pram!
Yes, I treat all your emails as spam.
Hurt your feelings? Don't care;
I don't like you, so there!
Just accept that I don't give a damn!

My goal is to balance my budget.
It's hard, but I don't much begrudge it:
No butter for bread;
It's marg'rine instead.
(While shopping at Nordstroms, I fudge it!)

A corf, full of coal, sees the light
As it's hauled up the shaft the full height.
Yet my time I consign
Workin' down in the mine,
Deep below, where it's darker than night.

"Your mom's an exceptor," screamed Heather,
"Objecting to me! She's your tether!
Our wedding, let's skip!
You're attached at her hip!
I just know you'll be happy together!"

Julie Andrews says fa is a long
Way to run, as she teaches in song.
It is post do, re, mi
And precedes so, la, ti;
But these notes, all off-key, I sing wrong.

Circular polarization:
A helix-shaped light wave formation
That travels through space
(Any time, any place)
To the Earth from the dawn of creation.

Why do I treat all your emails as spam?
