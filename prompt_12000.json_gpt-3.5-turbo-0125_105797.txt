"Pilar sheath acanthoma. Don't fear,"
Said the doctor, "it's easy to clear
With a quick little snip.
Keep a stiff upper lip."
"I don't want one, doc. That's why I'm here!"

When you badmouth male lawyers and blame
Them for all the world's ills, it's a shame.
It seems wrong to slang men
Just 'cause nine out of ten
Of them give all the rest a bad name.

"Hey, Mom, I've a chance at my dream —
The X-treme Harley Acrobats Team!"
She frowned at me, scaring
Me out of my daring:
She eyebrowed me out of my scheme.

Said a confident capo named Bonds,
"The sheriff is dragging those ponds
For those bums that we whacked
But he's screwed — that's a fact
'Cause he's finding just ditchmoss and fronds."

The cembra nut tree is Swiss pine.
And its resins and nuts?—they're both fine.
It's an evergreen tree,
And it always will be
A particular favorite of mine.

On Advent some folk glorify
Christ's birth with lit candles held high,
But those less devout,
If they're merchants, might shout:
"Only twenty-eight days left to buy!"

Where should barium sulfate lay blame
For having much more than one name?
It's heavy spar, barite,
Barytes and baryte.
They're many, but all mean the same.

The physicist  paled. He'd been goaded
By a priest's words, religiously loaded:
"What a bucket of piss!
Big Bang theory is this:
Naught existed, yet somehow exploded!"

Arboretums are surely to please.
They're gardens devoted to trees.
You'll be glad that you stayed
In a sun-dappled glade —
Unless you're allergic and sneeze.

You spit consonants out like a jet;
Your essssses and efffffs get me wet.
Your showery fricatives
Call for exsiccatives —
Hand me a dry towelette.

"Butterfingers! Klutz!" Hear Mom scold.
"Grampa's beer stein was 90 years old!"
It slipped right through my hands.
A severe right cross lands
On my jaw and that's it. I'm out cold.

His false piety's easy to see.
He's a hypocrite, human debris.
His acts? Sanctimonious—
Not vile and felonious.
We all feign to a certain degree.

Pastor Dan is firm denominationalist.
And the group that he leads? Congregationalist.
Every Sunday he's viewed
Holding services nude,
Since he's always been quite the sensationalist.

The passengers airside are "clean,"
Having passed the security screen.
Those landside, however,
Are "dirty," so never
Relax your surveillance—stay keen.

An adventurous gal, name of Ruth,
Conquered mountains, took lovers, turned sleuth.
All the wild things she'd done
Well before twenty-one
Had scandalized half of Duluth.

That cake that you baked for me? Gracie ate it.
That steak that you cooked for me?  Stacy ate it.
It seems my sad fate
Is to keep losing weight,
But please!  I'm already emaciated!

Chinese lanterns, each calyx fluorescent
After blooming, expand. They're tumescent.
They continue to grow
Though their blooms had to go.
Post-maturity growth? That's accrescent.

A girl with ambivalent goals
Loves to follow white rabbits down holes.
If she grows very small,
Could she shrink very tall,
Eating cake, drinking tea, switching roles?

"Sailing westward from Sicily, you
Reach these islands, delightful but few.
They are called the Aegates—
More Heaven than Hades—
Historical too!" "True? Who knew!"

Oxymoron? Don't know that I would
Go and nominate dangerous good.
While the term's not ethereal
(It's scary material),
It's self-contradicting.  I should!

On a scale when I last checked my weight
Was this reading, in pounds: 308.
I'll forego all things greasy,
Go easy on cheesy
Bean dips, and put less on my plate.

Beware of the mountebank's pitches
Extolling this plant: Dutchman's-breeches.
Its effects sometimes clash;
It can treat or cause rash.
There are much better treatments for itches.

When omnipotence flows from my soul,
All the cosmos within my control,
All of Heaven and Earth
Shall profess my great worth.
Almightiness:  that is my goal.

Is the candidate red? Purple? Green?
Or some alternate shade in between?
Should his private-life blues
Make the six o'clock news —
His true colors? He'll have to come clean.

Our most serious faces we don
As the blamestorming session goes on.
Someone died. Who's to blame?
The one person we name
Is a janitor's helper named Juan.

An arbor, free standing, with view:
One entrance (you cannot walk through).
While the pergola frame
Might appear much the same,
It's a "covered way" — entrances two.

If you're with a Scots lass around noon
And look up and you see the full moon,
In surprise you'd say, "Love,
There's the moon up above!"
She'd say, "Nae say 'above', say 'aboon'."

Kate arranged a blind date: "You'll meet Joey.
He's a bit ostentatious and showy,
Though his tales won't be bores.
He is seldom outdoors,
So his face may look pasty or doughy."

Nick was living the high life — such glamour,
All funded by work as a scammer.
He hacked some accounts,
Stealing hefty amounts:
Now the Nicker's banged up in the slammer.

What a kooky contraction is an't!
This colloquial term can supplant
Words like aren't and ain't,
Even amn't, a quaint
Little phrase others use, but I shan't.

In building a building, the beams
Form the frame, but they also, it seems,
Are the lights from a lighthouse
(The warn-ships-at-night house)
And smiles seen on championship teams.

A brazier's where burgers are turned;
A brassiere's with a bosom concerned.
Fellows, heed my advice
(And don't even think twice):
Keep your hands off of both—you'll get burned.

We were hunting and Bob shot a deer.
We turned back toward the lodge for a beer.	
"It's not heavy," I said,
"So, Bob, you grab the head
And start walking — I'll bring up the rear."

Though he made an unfortunate gaffe,
Joseph Biden now has the last laugh.
He is shouting with glee,
"I've been picked as V.P.
Since they think I am wheat and not chaff."

A fellow named Jung (first name Carl)
Allowed us our dreams to unsnarl,
Showing themes centered 'round
All the archetypes found
Within psyches, which might gnash and gnarl.

Up in heaven it's white as the snow,
And the weather is hot down below.
While my choice (though I ski)
Is not one of degree,
Still your offer of wealth I'll forgo.

"For your cataracts, this plant's a killer!
Don't grind it to put in a pill," her
Mom tells her. "Its juice
Is the part put to use:
Just a drop from a fresh dusty miller."

What the heck am I going to do
To help make what I broke look like new?
I suspect there's a trick
That'd get it to stick,
But I fear that I don't have a glue.

If a rabbi will drive in his car
To the mall on Shabbat (pretty far!),
His unorthodox ways
Will speak of his days
As a member of CCAR.

A biotelemetric device
Offers measurements—cool and precise.
From afar I can note
With my TV remote
That my wife is now colder than ice.

My rich friends on the yacht were impressed,
By a tall curvy blonde. (What a chest!)
Though the bimbo played dumb,
She was smarter than some,
Who succumbed to her every request.

When facing a false accusation,
Beware of unwanted vexation:
Review your defence
To be sure it makes sense,
And be ready for cross-examination.

When Israel's children came home,
Adin set up his tent in the loam.
Saying "We've been away
For many a day.
No more will we wander or roam."

My wife's biological clock
Is ringing to wake Dr. Spock!
So, now that we've lunched,
Time to get my card punched,
And start work at producing a flock.

Caput mortuum (English: "dead head")
Is the alchemists' name (naught to dread!)
For the dregs that remain
From their trying, in vain,
To gain (how insane!) gold from lead.

"You must stop this cavorting and prancing,"
Daddy said. "There's no future in dancing."
But she joined Ballets Russes,
And heard no more abuse.
She was praised—her jetés? "Life-enhancing!"

Acidification is handy
(But not in the making of candy).
It stops apples from browning,
And piemen from frowning;
The tartness it adds is just dandy.

You've no air? Take my recommendation:
Ventilation will aid respiration.
This is open-and-shut—
Pull your head from your butt
So you won't die of ass-phyxiation.

In the '60s, as history states,
Voted up with the motoring 'greats'
(Built by Jaguar cars—
Known as one of their stars)
Was the E-Type (desired by my mates).

This country is still a bit new:
Czech Republic they call it, but who
Can tell why—why the heck—ya
Don't simply say Czechia?
(Now Czechoslovakia is two!)

Though I know he's earned cottage decrees,
He's developed old-timer's disease.
Those are eggcorns at work,
Meant to fetch forth a smirk—
Misconstructions. Now, cut to the cheese.

He had struggled for years to accuse
Our prez of a far-reaching ruse,
But the end of his work
Was folks thought him a jerk.
Now he gives us his views on Fox News.

A cururo was cleaning his burrow
When a thought caused his eyebrows to furrow.
"I'm a rodent from Chile
And I don't think I really
Need to be so darned neat or so thorough."

Aclarubicin, when it is used,
Leaves leukemia patients enthused.
When you're choosing, be smart;
It won't damage your heart.
Other medicines should be refused.

Those blackguards, those dastardly knaves
Who deposed him, are out on the waves,
As he speaks, blown asunder —
But not going under
To languish in watery graves.

There's a dieting guru called Valerie
Who garners the healthiest salary.
Her food range (extensive)
Is so darn expensive,
It works out as £10 per calorie.

Cyberslacking, I guess, is not right;
I'm not working, I'm shirking tonight.
My net surfing's a crime
During company time —
I've just found a great limerick site.

When I look in the mirror I see
An admiring reflection of me.
Then it's joined by three more:
What a fabulous four!
Which are clones? Here's a clue—I'm called Three.

A couple, gourmand and gourmet,
Ordered food from a local café.
The gourmet took a bite—
Further interest was slight.
(The gourmand gobbled both plates away.)

The abbacy's vaudeville revue
Featured many an abbot's debut,
But they laughed fit to burst
At the straight man on first:
That's the Abbott who showed up with Lou.

Cry it out, girl! He left you, this fellow.
Keep weeping until you feel mellow.
As time passes by
You will see he was sly,
And his teeth, girl, let's face it, are yellow.

In a tony Fifth Avenue bootery,
I heard spoken, "Such upper-class snootery!"
This apt turn of phrase—
Such an image conveys!
I remarked on her charming bijouterie.

An Angora's a goat or a cat.
The cat, who's from Turkey, is fat.
The goat has a habit
Of pulling a rabbit
With fine silky hair from his hat.

The apiary's where they flung us:
Soon hornets and bees buzzed among us.
We swatted, of course,
But with little remorse,
They just stung us and stung us and stung us.

Uncle Jock is carnaptious; he's like
A great piledriver hitting a spike.
His temper is quick
As a conjurer's trick,
And you never know when he will strike.

In the ocean, "Fall off!" Captain roared.
Robert thought, "Is he out of his gourd?"
I'm sure he'll explain
With discussion profane,
After first pulling Bob back on board.

New Year's Day: I resolve on ignoring
Jokes with sexual themes, such as whoring.
While a few might have class,
Most are juvenile, crass,
Unoriginal, sexist and boring.

Perched high at their tall, eyrie station,
Great eagles in deep convocation
Tear flesh as they chat,
Clearly chewing the fat—
What I'd give for a decent translation!

I don't know, so I'll have to confer
With my husband, the man I call "Sir".
I'll consult, we'll discuss,
Then with little more fuss
I'll be able, or not, to concur.

When a man wandered deep in thick fog,
Slipped and flipped as he tripped on his dog,
Landed flop on the top
Of some vile, viscous slop,
He became just a lump on a bog.

There's a word that you recently read,
But you don't understand it, you said.
It's archaic, implying
Its usage is dying,
And folk who once kent it are dead.

That cigar box fits more than just smokes
And is useful to quite a few folks.
Store your marbles, a tool,
Or some pencils from school
To jot down your most Freudian jokes!

With emphaticness, some people state
That 16 minus 12 equals 8.
They believe that all doubt
Is dispelled if they shout.
Objectivity's something they hate.

My mechanic approached with a frown:
"Though your pistons still go up and down,
And your engine is churning,
The wheels are not turning—
Your crankshaft fell out back in town."

John's deprisure of Marsha's well known;
He belittles her over the phone.
He yells, "Idiot! Jerk!"
When he calls her from work:
He's a talk-show host. Listeners groan.

As botanical garden curator,
I will put off retirement till later,
And forfeit vacations
To maintain notations—
Plant data work couldn't be greater.

"I'm so greedy", said she, with a grin.
"I'll exploit my dad's fame — I'll cash in
With If clothing's your passion
Ivanka's your fashion!
With a daddy like mine, gotta win."

Brutish and blaming, for he
Is as .......... ignorant as he can be.
Grant no ... grace to a man
Of the ....... other man's clan —
That's the . theory that bigots decree.

Brick and mortar stores, even the malls,
Have now gone on the web (no more walls).
I just click on my mouse—
Stuff shows up at my house
Very quickly without any stalls.

In his landscape design, Calvert Vaux
Often sought to think outside the baux.
Having planned Central Park,
He might justly remark:
"This design is not mine, it's New Yaux."

A bugbear's not only for tots.
As a grown-up, I also have lots:
Telemarketers' calls,
Bosses busting my balls,
Drunken drivers, inflation, the trots.

Grain and sacrificed animals (male)
Used for offerings, blessings prevail,
And the glory of God
Shone before them abroad:
They fell frontwards, soon prostrate (and pale).

A bog is this wet, mushy ground
That is making that wet, slushy sound.
Let's take care here, my dear;
If we don't, then I fear
We'll submerge and might never be f

What came out of the woodwork today
Showing Jack in a negative way
Was that email he sent
Where he'd "never repent"
For that "great night" he spent with René.

That mistake ought to make your face red; it
Was hard not to laugh when you said it.
A face saver supplies
The excuse (maybe lies)
That is keeping your street-cred in credit.

"What you've got is severe echolalia—"
"What you've got is severe echolalia."
"That we've treated for years—"
"That we've treated for years."
(And our cure, it appears, is a faylia.)

Any gastropod, sluggish or fleet,
Exudes slime. Some are lovely to eat.
While each snail has a shell,
Slugs do not (mostly). Well,
All have tummies that double as feet.

The twins (who were monozygotic)
Embraced with a fervor hypnotic,
But their parents, who'd split,
Merely found them a bit
Uncontrollably antimitotic.

A dybbuk, the wandering soul
Of a dead man, has taken control
Of my body; so, dear,
It's that troll you caught here—
And not me—with your sister Nicole.

Mike's a genius, as smart as they come. He's
Got me, birdbrained Bill, as a chum. He's
Just called me a shnook,
So I bought him a book
Called Discovering Dumbness for Dummies.

An advance man's prime job: intervene
In the weeks 'fore his candidate's seen.
He grapples with airlines,
Diminishing hairlines,
And every detail in between.

Was he crazed? Not a whit. Scotch those rumours.
Shakespeare's  crasis — his blending of humours —
Was in exquisite balance.
That (and manifold talents)
Made him one of life's brightest illumers.

He has doveship — sweet, innocent Ted,
And telling him's something I dread,
But I'm running away
To join my friend Faye,
And down the gay path we will tread.

Some measures of costliness turn
Not on price, but on scorn that you earn.
Jacko's face lifts weren't cheap,
But he looks like a creep
And gets mocked despite money to burn.

There was high consternation, they say,
In the coin mint in Chile that day,
When a spelling mistake
Did an error coin make
Then a 'Chile coin carnage' affray.

I imagine it—here's what I mean:
It's envisioned. In dreams it is seen
By the eyes of my mind.
In my brain you will find
My design for an upscale latrine.

I was shocked when the newscaster said
Carrie Fisher, at 60, was dead.
One could never ignore
She was clearly far more
Than a princess with buns on her head.

Clerks at 7-11 are curt
To the hairy-backed, big-bellied Burt.
"Oh, for God's sake," one snapped.
"Dude, you've got to adapt,
And conformably throw on a shirt!"

When I chugalug beer with my frat boys,
Empty calories may make us fat boys.
We've been told that this booze
In excess makes some lose
Earthly life. If that happens, we're stat boys.

The Cubism school Analytic
Drew kudos from many a critic.
Picasso and Braque
Rendered facets like rock
In forms angular, square, pyramidic.

Jeanie screamed, "My best brooch has been took!
Was it you, son? You're just a wee crook!"
But the gallus wee Burnie
Just answered, "Amurnie!
But gie us ten notes, an' ah'll look."

Once called Albyn by Celtics of old,
Now it's Scotland (the Highlands still hold
That name), but till Caesar
(If you get a brain-teaser)
All of Britain was called that, I'm told.

Detected, my acts are on view;
And Big Brother is watching you, too.
This is hard to forgive
When I think that I'd live
With more privacy locked in a zoo.

Atop the large mound grew thick yarrow,
But it took an old farmer's sharp harrow
To turn up the ground
Where he suddenly found
Old bones in mass graves in a barrow.

When it's Phelpses we start to discuss,
Someone's certain to kick up a fuss,
For the folks at Wit's End
Are so far round the bend
Being nuts is an optional plus.

Amphictyony comes from Old Greek
When the city-states lay cheek-to-cheek.
It means joined in a pack
To defend or attack
So the strong can make up for the weak.

We are launching a large-scale petition
In our drive to improve school nutrition.
We'll convince all we can;
Should we fail, let us plan
For an alternate, fall-back position.

Assignment: "Write lims on each word,
Though most, we are sure, you've not heard."
For days I stared, blear-eyed,
And drank too much beer. I'd
Been shunning the trite rhyme absurd.

Attached to the plow we've displayed
Is a bull tongue, a very wide blade.
It exhibits its worth
For the tiller of earth
When the crop that he harvests is weighed.

In the doorway he'd lean on his broom,
His bay window occluding the room.
That commodious gut,
Like a belt-girdled hut,
Blocked the sunlight—the torso of doom.

In the hall there was laughter and din
As the act sang of poor Mickey Finn.
After each naughty verse
(Each progressively worse),
All the crowd, for the burden, joined in.

A biologist?  No, I am not.
I make puns, and I will 'til I rot.
I love language erotic
And eukaryotic,
Like alga and algae, a lot.

"I'll explain the cutaneous vein.
It's a vessel for blood that will drain
From your skin. Blood will flow
Into deep veins below,"
Said Elaine. "Do I make myself plain?"

I've not hid my iniquity. See,
I acknowledge my sin unto thee.
I'll confess my transgressions;
Accept my confessions;
Extend thy forgiveness to me.

Through the churchyard they came in a surge
Of black clothing, fulfilling the urge
To respect his sad passing.
Then the mourners amassing
Sang a sorrowful  funeral dirge.

His hands were raised over his head
As he shouted, "Don't shoot!" it was said.
Witness statements in court
Made that story fall short
(Not before the false narrative spread).

Though outdoors, all is covered in snow,
In my hearth, logs are softly aglow.
Let it freeze, let it storm—
I'll stay cozy and warm
By the fireside, with nowhere to go.

A blood count effectively tells
You the number of red and white cells
In a blood sample, and
Helps your doc understand
What is wrong, when it sounds warning bells.

While whistling a whimsical shanty,
She cheerfully put in her ante.
"No sir, I'm no joker...
We're playing strip poker,
So why can't I ante my panty?"

Though the citizenry did have their say
When they went to the ballot that day,
And preferred Gore to Bush,
Hell, when shove came to push,
The decision went quite the wrong way.

"Keep writing good lims," Strolin preached.
"Use grammar that's good," speedy teached.
Take a journey with me
And we'll make it to "z"
When our anapest destiny's reached.

Agricola, ruling for Rome,
In Britain, so far from his home,
Fought Welshmen and Scots,
But Domitian's fell plots
Were the ones that interred him in loam.

Great-aunt Philly's remarks, always telling
(To obsessive-compulsives, compelling),
Are quite mad, but that helps,
Since old Auntie's a Phelps
Who makes maxims on kelps deck her dwelling.

Searching deep in her wide-open eyes,
I forget all around. How time flies
When you're deeply engrossed
With the sight you love most.
I'm an oculist: there my heart lies.

Consider the term Christian year.
It's a concept that ought to bring cheer.
Life should never seem bleak;
As we live week to week,
All the saint's days and feast days appear.

The prospectus contained a neat bit:
"If you want better grades, quicker wit,
Deeper insights, more stories
To tell, higher glories,
You must take Comparative Lit."

No professors, no backpacks, no noting,
No theses, no school board promoting
Devotion to knowledge
At Electoral College,
Where everyone majors in voting.

I been workin' this mine maybe four
Or five years — I lost count — maybe more.
When beginning, I betted
I'd never be debted,
Yet I owe all my pay to their store.

I once knew a man from Peru
Whose limericks stopped at line two.
This had an effect,
As you well might expect,
On the workshopping comments he drew.

There's no reason that we need to warn a
Motorist that we have drawn a
Clamp down on speeders,
(Get cash from the bleeders!)
With cameras on every street corner.

Here's a really old family name—
We are told that from Scotland it came
(Abernethy's the place):
But Ralph honors his race
With his name and his great claim to fame.

For the game tonight, coach has a plan:
In the paint, body up to your man.
Stick so close he can't turn,
Pass, or shoot; you should learn
His deodorant—Right Guard or Ban?

In Boston Town, back in the day,
Arthur Gilman filled in the Back Bay.
He said, "Won't it be grand
When this swamp's turned to land?
We can shop... grab a bite... catch a play..."

Now his rag's voted "Best in the Nation",
The Chief Editor's filled with elation,
With reporters ecstatic,
And printers emphatic
It's bound to increase circulation.

If you take a tuberculin test,
Cell immunity kicks in. Impressed?
It is cell-mediated,
And quite underrated,
But potent, my doctors suggest.

An exfoliant, spread on the skin,
Helps the dead layer peel, and within
Are the shiny and new
Cells of skin. Sadly, you
Are still left with that wobbly chin.

Jim's a gymnophobe. Scared of a gym?
No, a gym won't unnerve Jim. Not him.
This poor puritan prude
Gets alarmed if you're nude.
Bare with Jim? Then please keep the lights dim.

Whilst Adam was praying in chapel,
Young Eve popped around with an apple.
"Dear," she said, "take a bite!"
Which he did, with delight;
Now with knowledge of evil they grapple.

What's the chance of my staying?  Remote.
I'm a drifter.  Not one to devote
Too much time in one place
Or one job, I keep pace
With my aimlessness; onward I float.

This wood's chippy. You cut it, it splits,
Forming chips: small, irregular bits,
Useless splinters of wood!
For our work it's no good.
I'm not joking: this stuff is the pits.

The extravagantness of our spending
Is seemingly, dear, never-ending.
To me it is clear,
Thanks to lavishness, we're
On the Staircase to Poorhouse, descending.

Through the curtainless windows I stare,
On a ladder way up in the air.
A voyeur I am not,
But that babe sure is hot.
(I was washing the windows, I swear!)

Said sad Eve, "Ad, I'm grieved! We're directed
To leave! God's aggrieved! We're infected
With sin!" So they went,
Thus disparadised, sent.
Eden's stamp on their visa:  REJECTED.

Grandma's badly in need of repairs.
Like a  goose with the gapes, she just stares,
Mouth hung wide. "There's no doubt
There are gapeworms about,
Which she's et," Grandpop gravely declares.

"At noon, let the battle commence"
Was the order.  The atmosphere's tense
In the foot-soldiers' ranks—
They are dying for thanks
From the generals, thirty miles hence.

Though the Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup
Used Freedonia, the actual scoop
Is the country drew praise
For some 33 days
(In the grand scheme of things, no big whoop).

There are liquids for waking me up.
There are liquids I sip when I sup.
When my stomach has troubles,
I drown them in bubbles—
That's 7-Up fizz in my cup.

Said a swishy, effeminate nancy,
"Having condomless sex isn't chancy."
Airy-fairy, this man
Has no sensible plan.
He should stop taking flights of pure fancy.

I'm a rancher in need of relief:
Calf diphtheria's causing me grief.
With this scourge on the go
Through my herd, there are no
Cafeterias buying my beef.

Cairns-Smith has a theory outré:
That our ultimate origins may
Be unearthed in formations
Of sedimentations
That replicate: crystals of clay.

"What's an exoplanet, Mom?" queried Janet.
"In deep space, our new telescopes scan it.
It orbits afar
Around some other star,
But it may seem like Earth, our home planet."

To exorcize spirits, pray tell,
Can you teach me a failure-proof spell
To expel the fell demon
Who dries up my semen—
Back to dwell in his cell down in Hell?

The directors most certainly talk,
And the shareholders fly and won't walk.
Imitation, quite naughty,
Is this company's forte:
Run by parrots, the brand name is 'Squawk'.

On these walls there's a fine Doric frieze;
It was made with one purpose: to please.
See that channel or groove?
I'll be happy to prove
It's a glyph—found on walls such as these.

The centigram isn't much used
In Australia, because we perused
Both the kilo- and milli-
gram, found them less silly,
And centigrams simply refused.

I grew an incredible beard
For my part as the villain — I'm feared!
But my fingers and hand
For the hearingless band
Helped them all understand — so they jeered!

Broken light from small droplets that grew
In the morn makes a colorful view!
All the bladelets of grass
Carry "diamonds"—of glass?—
No, of water, reliquefied: dew!

You've got babies-in-the-eyes: a reflection?
Of whom? This bears further inspection:
Tiny mirrors of me
To a pint-sized degree
On both orbs, and with all my perfection.

Here's the plan when your hunger attacks:
Sun-dried grapes make your tummy relax.
They're an energy burst;
You should reach for them first —
They're the best raisin d'etre for snacks.

When you eat out at Bubba Gump Shrimp
You don't need to dress up or to primp.
They serve food from the sea;
Specials line the marquee.
You'll be full when you're done. They don't scrimp.

A companion, old Rome would've said,
Is a person with whom you break bread.
But our more recent ways
Favor overnight stays—
And she'll likely want breakfast in bed.

Should you happen to step on an ant,
An apology then you should grant.
If he could respond
From beyond the beyond
He'd be likely to rant, but he can't.

An ala's a winglike extension
Of bone and a mode of ascension
Of insects that zoom.
It's a part of a bloom,
And a room Roman architects mention.

If a train trip's your personal heaven,
Come to Paddington, six past eleven,
Platform 3, carriage B,
And prepare to go "Squee!":
First Great Western will take you to Devon!

When this time zone applies, EET,
In Jordan or Greece you may be,
Or in Cyprus, Romania,
Perhaps Lithuania,
Or a state on the Bothnian Sea.

Just a pitiful, few-feathered thing,
An alula's not quite a wing.
It's more like a thumb,
Called a bastard by some,
Which has an unfortunate ring.

A polygon's apothem straight
(With apothegm do not conflate!)
Drawn from center, mid-side,
Gives the radius applied
To inscribing its circular mate.

I speak in a language arcane.
I've managed to learn to refrain
From words comprehensible
And thoughts somewhat sensible
Lest others decide that I'm sane.

Coincidence? No: too damn fluky.
Either purposely planned, or real spooky!
Six bikers rode by
In bikinis (oh, my)
And black boots, each astride his Suzuki.

Have a clapbread, not really a bread —
Made with oatmeal, a thin cake that's said
To be "clapped out" (not batted),
Or carefully patted,
And baked. It tastes good with a spread.

A lady-in-waiting, or burmaiden,
Might be better described as a hermaiden.
Then again, if her deeds
Deal with men's "special needs,"
One might easily call her a sirmaiden.

This natal chart's such a disaster;
We're on to you, fraudulent master.
Your claims we won't follow;
You're just an astrolo-
(Gasp!) gaster—a feigning forecaster!

With its architrave, cornice, and frieze,
The entablature poses with ease
On the columns, free standing.
Prevent a crash landing:
Secure it before the next breeze.

Calathea, the tropical plant,
Features green patterned leaves which enchant.
In pots, they repose
In suburban chateaus,
Adding oxygen plasma screens can't.

What initially seems naught but toil,
While you're digging to break up the soil
With straight rows and full spit,
Will ensure you keep fit.
Work that spade blade according to Hoyle.

Manila's municipal planners
Used abaca rope hanging banners.
We all were amazed
When they also had raised
A pedestrian walk — that's bananas!

In the acroceraunian pass,
Beware of the Hellene with brass.
Alexander was such:
One day, with his touch
Aristotle flipped o'er the crevasse.

He's so upright and gallant a wight
That there's none who's as parfit a knight.
None can even reach parity:
His sheer exemplarity
Leaves me in awe and uptight.

Enunciate each word you speak,
If respect as a speaker you seek.
If your words are not clear,
Or your accent's severe,
Then your chance for success will be bleak.

Shy and hornless, the chevrotain strives
To lead one of those cud-chewing lives.
Let the rainforests be,
Don't have bushmeat for tea,
And we'll hope that this "mouse deer" survives.

I could stay in one church, but my druthers
Is roaming from Brothers to Brothers.
As a gyrovague, I,
In my journeys, rely
On the handouts from brotherly others.

There's a mare to be serviced today—
In the air, a provoking bouquet,
So the colt's more than frisky.
Don't approach him; it's risky.
When he's cadgy, we keep folks away.

In the cold, you may catch a disease.
If it freezes, you'll cough and you'll sneeze.
So to match your barometer,
Here's a brand-new thermometer
That's calibrated into degrees.

The people who advertise cars
Spend more than those selling cigars.
With their goal they're obsessed:
That we autosuggest
(Like the notion to purchase is ours).

Are you planning a new piece of text,
But, by how you're to start, are perplexed?
I've a shortcut for you:
Control-N — stands for "new".
A clean page waits for what you'll do next.

My weight has experienced gains,
And the girdle no longer constrains
My abdominous thrust,
So I'll have to adjust
My bay window—and add a few panes.

The section of Brooklyn, Crown Heights,
Was a hill where the kids flew their kites.
Now a change it has shown,
And it's much better known
For religious observance and rites.

Kevin Phelps plays in goal for United,
But each game he appears in is blighted.
Be it cross, chip or shot,
Clueless Kev drops the lot—
Loves the game, but it's love unrequited.

Never shy when approaching a dame,
Dave moves forwardly, taking good aim.
Should she say he's too bold,
He won't quit; he won't fold.
Free of shame, he'll continue the game.

Is bipolar disorder a claim
For those crimes that have now made her name
So well known, brought up often?
Parents each in a coffin,
Lizzie Borden gets all of the blame.

Suspending himself from the apse
Of St. Paul's Cathedral, perhaps,
Was silly of Wren,
But no other men
Would test if the dome would collapse.

In the chamber we kids have outgrown,
There's a closet-like spot all my own.
It's a trifling space,
But this by-room's my place,
And the stool in the corner's my throne.

On those far rolling hills they're still farming;
This countryside view is so charming.
But on turning my head
I see townscapes instead,
And the rate of their spread is alarming.

Creep feed does not sustain creeps.
A creep's an enclosure that keeps
Farmyard creatures inside,
Where good farmers provide
Them with feed, not on plates, but in heaps.

Eco-friendly is our little farm:
It's designed to produce little harm
To the local community.
It provides opportunity;
It's fertile and bursting with charm.

Evolution's conferred many skills
On giraffes: they can race up steep hills,
Find food at their ease
In the tallest of trees,
And run up zoos' web server bills.

"Feast your eyes on my coat of mail fine,"
Quoth Sir Guy. "'Tis this season's design.
You can't help be a charmer
In flexible armour.
Lead me on to the wenches and wine."

Angel wings don't just help cherubs fly;
Many plants with that name please the eye.
But alas for a bird,
If that defect occurred
It could never fly into the sky.

Dry some animal fats and then titrate
The resulting ammonia and nitrate;
Spread the stuff on your fields,
Because ammonite yields
Great results if applied at the right rate.

This condition makes sufferers tire.
Caused by virus, you feel you're on fire,
And your vomitus, dark,
Means your outlook is stark—
With black vomit your prospects are dire.

Queen Arete earned great admiration
As top-ranking female Phaeacian.
So much virtue was seen
In this mythical queen
She became its personification.

There's this doggery back off the street
Where I dock when I need to retreat.
Even dark at high noon,
It's a gloomy saloon
Known to no one I'd go there to meet.

There's a breakthrough that's stirring much awe
Called CRISPR that's now a great draw
As a gene-edit tool —
It's incredibly cool
At locating and snipping a flaw.

Long ago, when young men studied Latin,
And young ladies wore corsets and satin,
To woo and beguile
Was a matter of style.
Now it's booty calls, webcams, and chattin'!

My son was a young adoptee.
I found him asleep in a tree.
I thought him pre-human
And named him Hanuman,
But perhaps he's a smart chimpanzee.

Every summer, come rain or come shine,
Swarms of ants fill the air in a sign
That there's love in the air.
For the males, this is their
Anty-climax (a bit like this line).

Forbidden fruit! Does that term ring a bell?
Serpent's ruse worked out ever so well.
Because Eve ate the apple
We all have to grapple
With pain, death, and going to Hell.

Right after the perp chose to flee,
Stations broadcast the cops' APB,
'Cause the car the crook stole
(Though it wasn't his goal)
Held a baby who napped through his spree.

With each decade I live through I face
The bleak prospect I'm losing the race:
Ten more years have flashed by
In the blink of an eye.
I think someone's been upping the pace!

At the fortress his ensign was furled
As his crown from the ramparts he hurled.
He resigned. He is free.
The Welsh king's on a spree
Like he hasn't a caer in the world.

I exploit all the sources I find.
I exploit all the forces I bind.
I exploit men's divorces.
I exploit men's remorses.
To exploit all, of course, is unkind.

I agreed, as a final resort,
I'd appear for my buddy in court
As a character witness,
To speak of his fitness
To take on his children's support.

He contrived to avoid every chore;
When the sarge raked him over, he swore.
He's lacking the mien
To become a Marine —
A bad apple, gone bad to the Corps.

In baseball you use a strong bat
Made of northern white ash—round, not flat
Like the Limeys' in cricket
Where the base is called wicket—
For the ball that you want to get at.

British accents are clipped and precise;
Lenis consonants never suffice.
Use full stops for your t's—
Never slur them as d's.
And your syncopal cemet'ry? Nice!

There's a green-colored Martian, I hear,
Who lost ninety-two prize fights one year—
Hit so often, it's said,
In the side of his head
That he now has a broccoli ear.

"They heisted our wildebeest, Paul!
I swear, I was just down the hall
For the length of a whiz."
"Not to worry. Thing is,
No gnus is good gnus, after all."

At the side of the dance floor you wait;
Others come, others go, you stagnate.
You are bashful and shy;
You're a diffident guy;
You're too slow to come forward, you're blate.

From parietal cells in our tums
A supply of digestive juice comes.
They produce HCl*
And our I.F.** as well,
Neither one of which helps digest gums.***

One might witness the elative case
Upon visiting Finland to trace
How the natives intone
Finnish suffixes known
To mean movement from out of some place.

As a caring, responsible medic,
To our drug woes I'm not apathetic,
So desist with the jokes
When I cocainize folks,
Since cocaine makes a great anesthetic.

Acris crepitans — fart-hoppers? Cool!
Some days it's worth going to school.
— No, they're frogs that go "cricket"
Like a World War II click-it.
Baby gators see tree frogs and drool.

A cartridge fuse lets any rube
Fix a fault without making a boob.
No need to perspire
Using pliers and wire,
You just clip in this fuse-in-a-tube.

Whensoever my hands start to shake,
My prescription is daunting to take.
Though I don't have a kid,
There's a babyproof lid.
Could it be someone's made a mistake?

I doubled up laughing. It's funny.
Do you think I still date weird ol'  Sonny?
When we go to the track,
That bloke bets his whole stack,
Then he doubles up, betting my money.

Though the others would try to defy us,
I've found a new source to supply us
With news we can use
To confirm all our views,
Since the other news pushes a bias.

Rainbow's ends and the hues in-between
Light your pots, each one sprouting a bean.
From the garden's reaction,
The spectrum of action
Shows nothing will grow in the green.

Equanimity: worries will cease
To leave calmness of mind. Like a grease
That's eased stressing, or pain,
What has taken the strain
Of anxiety's left you at peace.

Coincidentally, my son has big feet
As does Marvin, who lives down the street.
It's coincidence, sure,
Since my wife's chaste and pure,
And assures me she never would cheat.

When you're using acrylic to paint
(It's plastic-based, oil-based it ain't),
It's easy to clean—
Water-soluble, keen—
Quick to dry, it makes oil paint quite quaint.

Can you picture my canny old aunt
Dancing cancan, then stopping to pant?
I say, "Auntie, sit down!"
She replies with a frown,
"I've a cramp in my can, so I can't."

Baade's Window, when first he peered through,
Showed a cosmic, incomparable view,
And this small open door
To the Galaxy's core
Is enjoyed by a reverent few.

The bare-throated bellbird is loud
With a call that stands out in a crowd:
Like an anvil that's hit
Or a bell. I submit
If you're standing too close, you'll be cowed.

There's a color much loved, I've heard tell,
One to please any mademoiselle,
That is known as French blue.
It's their national hue,
Found on sports teams and racecars as well.

In the desert a flash, then high dust,
And our pilot recoiled, and he cussed.
We have not got much time;
I can see its swift climb:
To defocus its laser's a must!

There is not much that rhymes well with delf
In these books that I keep on my shelf.
There is booty (called pelf),
Santa's helper (an elf),
And then your-, one-, him-, her-, and itself.

I say split, disunite, break in two,
Based on color, the red and the blue!
Of course that would neatly
Divide us completely
In other ways — namely, IQ.

The Standardbred horse is no rotter:
He runs just as fast as he oughter.
Hambletonian 10
Was the first one, and then
He begat the American trotter.

At the world-famous Hollywood Bowl
They play music for soothing the soul,
But the rub is the crickets
(Who crash without tickets);
Their chirping is out of control!

A policeman, so shocked he was punchy,
Exclaimed, "There's a frog in this munchy??
I assume you, at least,
Took the bones from the beast?"
"Were it boneless, it wouldn't be crunchy!"

All your research is such a damn mess —
Calculations and facts in distress.
No footnotes or labels?
Statistical tables?
Exactness here's anyone's guess.

To collapse: "have a breakdown". My fate—
To collect word-collations; collate:
"Bring together"; collide:
"Have a crash"—and decide:
Don't collogue (or collude). No debate!

Manny's fantasm (fantasized specter)
Of his needs was a mental reflector.
Although hulking and hairy,
The ghost wasn't scary.
It was more of a friendly protector.

My brother's an air-hog. He soars
In an updraft: that lift he adores.
By the face of a bluff
Where the current's enough,
His hang time will always best yours.

My car stalled and the dashboard went black
On a grade crossing, right on the track.
The train's coming, can't brake.
Gotta bail! Should I wake
Dozing mother-in-law in the back?

The Casinos, a group of nine men,
Had a hit with a song titled "Then
You Can Tell Me Goodbye,"
Which would chart pretty high —
Made Top Ten.  Never happened again.

This may sound like a right load of cobblers,
But I miss bowling bland dibbly-dobblers.
Launched at medium pace,
Hit all over the place,
Striking sometimes with sly wibbly-wobblers.

They are wizened, these features of mine.
Of old age it is clearly a sign,
And my mind's full of drivel.
I've started to shrivel —
As I crine, I decline, I opine.

A friend of mine once had a car
That could talk, though its diction was far
Too precise. If a door
Hadn't shut, it would roar,
"You cretin, a door is a jar."

On his coffin, you laid a large wreath
For the artisan lying beneath.
I asked, "What did he do
For a living?"  and you
Answered, "Denturism—making false teeth."

I'm an answer-jobber working for Ask.
It's a thankless and ill-paying task.
I field questions from nerds
About bird-eating birds
With a constant companion: my flask.

An anterior drawer test will tell
If I've suffered a torn ACL.
I'm supine, and my knee's
Bent at 90 degrees.
Says my doc, "This won't hurt." (Yeah, like hell!)

While Waterloo Bridge has its bag ladies,
They're not in the slightest like hag ladies.
Beneath that fair bridge
They've installed a small fridge
For their Botox — they'll never be sag ladies.

Seems the town's had a hell of a fright:
Some damned killer broke free at first light.
Still, the deputy's shot him;
They've just about got him.
Watch his capture—replayed—late tonight.

When I see that our rules have been breached
And my sermon on evil's been preached—
Don't stand in my way,
I've got demons to slay—
For my boiling point's finally been reached.

Algedonics, I now shall explain,
Is the study of  things that pertain
To good feelings and bad
(Mind or body, I'll add):
It's the science of pleasure and pain.

My dentist had praised him effusively;
He's the broker we dealt with exclusively.
We invested our cash.
The result? Worse than trash;
Seems he'd promised large profits delusively.

Our cells have no bleaker prognosis
Than a self-death by sad apoptosis.
These poor cells, findings say,
Choose to end their tough day.
Hm, perhaps they seek metempsychosis?

While he toils at the dull, bureaucratic,
He wishes for life more chromatic.
But his past so pathetic
Seen in visions eidetic,
Intense and exact, leaves him static.

When a horse has a tail that's been clipped,
His rear end is no longer equipped
To brush skeeters and flies
From his haunches and thighs—
No surprise that a bobtail feels gypped.

Dear fans, re the letters you write:
Peace and love, but I'm losing the fight.
From October, I'm sure,
They'll be answered no more:
I've no time. Peace and love, and goodnight.

I was worried that Pat would attack
As I cringed and prepared for a whack.
But Pat's a good friend,
And it was, in the end,
Just a comradely pat on the back.

What do cruciverbalists learn?
