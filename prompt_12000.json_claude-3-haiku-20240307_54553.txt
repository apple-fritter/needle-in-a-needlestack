This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.

My life was unhinged and bourgeois,
So I turned to my roots, et voila!,
I grew out my beard
And Torah I revered,
Becoming baal teshuva.

Since her recent divorce, my aunt Min
Has had wrinkles appear in her skin.
She is no longer bold;
She's grown suddenly old,
Looking careworn, unhappy and thin.

The Agonyclites stood when they prayed,
Leaving others disturbed and dismayed.
The authorities felt
That they ought to have knelt,
And I think that they should have obeyed.

To compose a morose epicedium
Can brighten one's torpor and tedium.
I myself have an urge
To create a sad dirge —
One not overly mournful, just medium.

When making Canadian law,
The parliamentarians jaw—
And they may take all night,
If they happen to fight
With the ones from the Bloc Québécois.

When the butler is sounding the gong,
See their dinner gowns, slinky and long.
But when ladies depart,
Then the menfolk will start
To make bets on who's wearing a thong.

Send a cover sheet out with your fax
So it won't simply fall through the cracks.
List the issues involved
And we'll see they're resolved—
Basic facts, not the whole ball of wax.

While flipping a hamburger patty,
Poor Mitzi went quietly batty —
Said, "French fries with that?"
As she deep-fried a rat.
"There's no difference; it all ends up fatty."

I've decided to learn how to bake
And, unshaken, I'm planning to make
My first try as a rookie
A chocolate chip cookie,
Before I attempt chocolate cake.

People's sex lives can shock and appall.
Oh, it's strange all the things that enthrall.
Chains and whips, leather chaps,
But the weirdest, perhaps:
Aphallatia — no sex at all.

When deciding to lend you some cash,
Bankers never are hasty or rash.
They apply credit scoring
(A term that sounds boring)
To decide if you're trusty or trash.

The gambler, brow knit in a frown,
Watched his faro chip assets go down.
"This is rigged, so they say,
But I still have to play.
It's the only game left in this town."

Jake got caught with those hubcaps he steals.
Now he sits in jail cooling his heels—
Not the best of careers.
He'll serve one to two years,
'Less his lawyer can file some appeals.

This puss was abandoned, James knew,
And a stray takes a risk near a zoo,
So he whispered, "Here, kitty,"
And held out, from pity,
A hand — but the tiger took two.

An adept aquafortist named Dave
Using acid would etch and engrave.
One foul day, a bad leak
Saw some splash on his cheek.
He survived, though—a very close shave.

If you're hearing-impaired, no apology
Is required; consult the anthology
Of professions for one
That tests hearing — it's done
By those licensed to do audiology.

There oughta be some kind of law
When the gals in the office all jaw
About babies.  Obsessing,
They're always expressing
Delight with that sugary "Awwwww!"

We're direct-grant schools. Note, if you please,
Being frightfully posh, we charge fees,
But we tolerate proles
(Just a few) on our rolls,
'Cause the government pays us for these.

We're anarchists (rules will appall us),
Yet we dress with a smartness that's flawless.
We're tailored discreetly
And matched quite completely:
We needn't be slobs to be lawless.

Haunted houses are best viewed by night,
When there's not one sane person in sight.
If gales blow while it rains
And ghosts rattle their chains,
Then they're sure to deliver a fright.

It's that roll in his gait, you'll agree,
His white ducks and distaste for debris:
Since he crawled from the crib,
By the cut of his jib,
It's been clear that his true home's the sea.

There's a pigment that's yellowish-brown
For which bister's the relevant noun—
And it's bistered you get
When you soak it, and let
Jackson Pollock start going to town.

The first antidetonant, lead,
Did horrible things as it spread
From our cars to our plains,
Into little kids' brains.
Now we use safer octanes instead.

"From the left, take a fist," I declare,
As your punch hits from right.  Oh, despair.
That chiasmus up there
Has a pattern — just stare;
It's a cross that I'm sure you can bear.

You'd think nothing could make a man sadder
Than having a full, sloshy bladder,
Legs crossed at the knee
'Cause he's so full of pee —
Then the sprinklers start, making him madder.

A long parting again must be faced.
Hugging tightly, they fiercely embraced;
Every clasp in the past
Has proved fast love can last
When on friendship and loyalty based.

I said, "Joe, Daddy thinks that you're drony,
And I'm sure he believes you're a phony
With a proneness to shirk,
And allergic to work."
Joe was irked, and he bellowed: "Baloney!"

In two seconds, a setting's erased.
With a clock wipe, the scene is replaced:
Second hand sweeps around
And the film's on new ground—
Gives a place change an odd, vintage taste.

Some folks might think cranberry glass
Is for fruit of the cranberry class.
But it's glass of deep red,
With a gold sheen, and said
To be sought by the English top brass.

With chloramine we can be sure
That a potable state will endure
In the water we drink,
For we'd all like to think
That what flows from the tap's clean and pure.

Invitations don't always invite;
Dinner parties are often a fright.
Let the host mutter, "Weasels!"
We'll say we've got measles
And dine in, my darling, tonight.

While you went for a weekend to Rome,
Your new washer spat masses of foam.
It smothered the floor,
Barely dammed by the door:
You will need antifoam when you're home.

The devil produces a spark
Of power for spells in the dark.
Black arts are espoused
By people like Faust
Who bargain their souls for a lark.

In limerick writing, your meter
Is anapest.  Would it be neater
Wedding iamb and trochee?
That's not okey-dokey!
Use antispast?  Never, you cheater!

You amaze me, my dear Mr. Fox,
When you lift up that mountain of rocks.
I'm astounded and awed,
And I'm barefoot, by Gawd,
For your prowess has knocked off my socks.

My anesthesiologist, Jill,
Has a useful and wonderful skill.
She will keep you pain-free
Through your surgery, see—
But just wait till she sends you her bill.

Country mile: that's a long way to go?
All us hicks in the sticks would say no.
In Chicago, a mile
Takes an hour (what a trial!)—
Around here, just a minute or so.

An ultrasound scan can detect
Venous flow, by the Doppler effect.
It will show if you've got
A vein blocked by a clot
When a DVT's what to suspect.

Said I, to the database lass,
"Your server's become a morass.
Your front-end is fine
(Handles better than mine),
But your back-end's a pain in the ass."

For most 'bee stings' the bees take the fall,
Though it isn't the bees' fault at all;
Vespine pests, yellow jackets
Undertake an attack; it's
A typical day's ER call.

With amazingly great gifts I'll ply you:
First to Normandy, France I will fly you.
Next, a New Orleans creek
I will mail you next week.
Yes, that's Bayou Bayeux I will buy you.

Fumed a bee with a flap of its wing,
"We can't gather up pollen or sting!
Something's clogged our corbiculae,
Soddened our spiculae:
Rain is a terrible thing!"

At a wedding reception in Cana,
The dear bride was a beauty, a sheyna,
And one guest was so fine
He turned water to wine
And the groom to a former abstainer.

Amarantaceous indeed!
Common "pig" is the name of this weed.
Those sesquipedalian
Words are so alien;
Smart Alecs ain't what we need.

When you come to our marshmallow store,
You'll find oil drums of Fluff on the floor.
We found barrels no good,
Since the slivers from wood
Prompted negligence lawsuits galore.

On those far rolling hills they're still farming;
This countryside view is so charming.
But on turning my head
I see townscapes instead,
And the rate of their spread is alarming.

To my fans, I admit my indebtedness;
Having failed them, I feel a regrettedness
That my Broadway career's
Disappeared—no more cheers.
It's gone foul, with malodorous fetidness.

Your dementia evolves by degrees,
As your brain's forming holes like Swiss cheese.
Now you firmly avow
That you suffer "mad cow",
Though you've caught Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

This delusion I have of negation
Is a matter of utmost frustration
To those who agree
That there is a world. Me?
I just know it's a long-dead location.

There's a break in line 5 of this verse,
A short tale of a murderous nurse.
I had come to her ward
For some warts I'd ignored,
But went home the next day…             in a hearse!

Sure, an octopus might use a tool,
But some trivia even more cool?
A consortium's when
There's a lot more than ten.
I suppose they're too smart for a school.

Acinetiform's not what I'm called.
Such a thought has me quite unenthralled,
Since I'm neither suctorial,
Nor at all infusorial
And by matter decayed I'm appalled.

I know you won't find me pedantic
When I tell you this beetle's gigantic.
It measures six inches;
With "horns," the bug pinches.
Why do schoolgirls find beetles romantic?

Dancing farandoles earned us some praise:
Threading Needles, escaping The Maze.
Our footing was certain,
Our clothing was curtain;
St Sepulchres: those were the days.

One would hope, in a crisis, benevolence
Would be the response that takes prevalence.
But alas, we have seen
People tend to be mean,
And delight in their senseless malevolence.

Said the teacher, "Use all of your brain —
How much sand will this basin contain?"
The class scratched its head,
'Til one genius said:
"A basinful, sir, it is plain."

Two lessons were learned from the strife
That was faced by George Bailey and wife.
One: an angel earns wings
Every time a bell rings,
And then two: it's a wonderful life.

Veggies strewn on a plate like confetti
Are brunoise.  The chef got them ready
By dicing real fine
(One-eighth inch is divine)
While she's keeping her knife sharp and steady.

Good Samaritan laws can protect you
From lawsuits you fear might deflect you
From helping a stranger
Who's facing a danger.
The courts will (correctly) respect you.

"Has the Girdle of Venus been banned
From all stores? I just don't understand.
I've looked high, I've looked low—"
"Further search please forgo.
It's right there in the palm of your hand."

From our duck-hunting, home via Daniel's.
He said, "Bring some deodorant granules
Next time out, for that fug —
Rotting rug — makes me chug."
That's the trouble with wet cocker spaniels.

A creationist posits the cause
Of all life that on Earth ever was
Must be God, because life
Begets life; now it's rife
And complies with its Prime Mover's laws.

Drawings, diagrammatically sound,
That plot out the lie of the ground
(Landscape plans, with no hues,
Flat, cross-sectional views),
Stir no joy in my soul, I have found.

"Listen, boys," said field officer Joe
To the sergeants, lieutenants (below
His own major's rank) "we
Will capture this tank. We
Will deal all these devils a blow".

We've got C-rations, some fit to eat,
With their tins of unspecified meat
(Which some claim is wombat.
But hell, this is combat),
And coffee and fudge. Ain't that sweet!

When an actor attempting a leap
Missed his mark and fell into a heap,
The censor (God love her)
His mouth could not cover,
But hid his loud curses with BLEEEEEEP.

An enantiomorphic connection
Resembles a mirror's reflection.
The form of the first
Is the second, reversed.
You've a pair close at hand for inspection.

Would the Democrats find it a blessing
If their two top contenders stopped pressing
To be first and became
A merged team with one aim—
C-and-O,  their best skills coalescing?

Vacationing, I shall make hay,
And service my joy, come what may,
As I coin verbs denominative
To show I'm predominative
And leverage my MBA.

Having stop, cease, desist on their mind,
Pirate captains might say, you will find,
"Avast behind!" This
Could be taken amiss
By their crews, who could think them unkind!

While prowling his base's perimeter
Major Tom wore his medals and scimitar.
When he shouted, "Jump to it!"
Troops knew to construe it
As "high 'nuff to need an altimeter."

When the Pinto arrived at my station,
It suffered from poor carburetion.
I started to fix
The gas/oxygen mix
But got high from the fuel's emanation.

On the beaches of Puerto Vallarta
Are Canadians; Greeks live in Sparta;
And in Java, the Dutch
Don't do anything much,
Except ask you the way to Batavia.

She's been out for a night on the tiles;
Staggers home, sees the phone, and drunk dials—
"You can keep your damned bitch,
But I'll sue, and be rich.
And your 'son'? Well, here's news, hon. He's Lyall's."

Ammodramus, a genus of sparrows,
Features several with tails sharp as arrows.
From the fens where they skulk
They eat grass seeds in bulk
And snatch bugs by the dawn and dusk scarrows.

"But he got fewer votes!"—that's your spin
When you call into question his win.
But contest all you will.
Will you protest until
The electoral loser gets in?

From its blossoms, a lovely perfume
Fills the air when this vine is in bloom.
Chilean jasmine is fine
In a garden like mine;
Brought inside it brings scent to each room.

What's a chaetopod? That is a term
That's applied to an annelid worm,
As its bristle, or seta,
Is known as a chaeta.
These beasties can make people squirm.

"I was walking along when my skin
Started dripping right off of my chin,
Till my whole epidermis
Filled a two gallon thermos!"
Is a lie this dermatic a sin?

My Chemistry grade's a disgrace.
The compound they gave me to trace
As my final exam
Was an ampholyte; damn!
I just couldn't tell: acid or base?

The last boat floats away from the shore.
Now I wish I had boarded before,
But I couldn't decide.
Was it sloth?  Was it pride?
Does it matter at all anymore?

I have an old burro named Jo
Who is cranky, obnoxious, and slow.
Still she's such a sweet ass,
So I travelled to Mass.
And I married her, loving her so.

The waterscape, ebbing and swelling —
Mesmeric, engrossing, dispelling
All thoughts from your mind
As your daydreams unwind —
Is hypnotic, alluring, compelling.

"Our best suspect, I've learned, has a twin,"
Said the chief, with a look of chagrin.
"He'll try some kind of switch,
So be sure which is which.
In your search for him, factor it in."

The first book review! (Yes, my first book,
Which I wrote on some gobbledygook!)
I was proud, man, but then
Read the text once again—
The reviewer, I found, was a schnook.

All the audience shouted "Right on!"
When shrewd Newt tried his media con.
Some feel he berated
Poor Williams. Not sated,
He teed off; scored a clean hole in Juan.

In the late 1800s they came,
Profiteers—from old settlers to claim,
In the wake of lost war,
The spoils, legal, and more,
And today they're still doing the same.

When my  brother and I built our den
(I'd be six-and-a-half; he'd be ten)
In that bracken-clad ditch,
We felt safe; we felt rich
And as happy as pigs in a pen.

My blonde wife is impressive in height,
And her beer mug's an everyday sight.
She appears German-looking
While sauerkraut-cooking,
But was born on our own Isle of Wight.

I get lost from the den to the loo;
Once arrived, I've no clue what to do.
My confusional state
Means I'm usually late
For appointments… except those with you.

The captain, face pale, turned to me.
"Here, use this bailing out this huge sea!"
"Captain, give me a pail
If you want me to bail.
This spoon's not for sea, it's for tea!"

It's wonderful stuff, cotton waste,
For cleaning machines (not in haste).
It soaks up the oil
Without too much toil,
But its downside has got to be faced.

If you can't find a purpose in life,
And you yearn for the noose or the knife,
Your unrest is anomic
And seriocomic:
You're living in Scotland in Fife.

Congregationalism's a sect;
All adherents, in Christ, are elect.
Each self-governing church
Sits alone on its perch;
Popes and bishops they roundly reject.

As he's hurrying past on the boat,
She's aware of the brush of his coat.
With the contact, this miss
Now imagines his kiss,
And she stifles a gasp in her throat.

A pessimist sadly conceded
His hairline had sharply receded.
His wife is more bullish:
"What's left is quite fullish!"
To me, his head's bigger than needed.

"What? You plan to defang that large asp?"
I declared, feeling scared and agasp.
"Pulling fangs from a snake
Makes me quake. For God's sake,
If you do, keep a mighty firm grasp!"

The three women of 9 Chickweed Lane
All live lives that are far from mundane.
These three generations
Encourage flirtations.
(They often have sex on the brain.)

Any pipe—when a liquid goes through it—
Has a name that is hard to intuit.
Start with KAHN-dit. Sound stiff? Wrong?
Then switch to a diphthong:
Choose KAHN-doo-it, –dyoo-it, or –djoo-it.

When electing MPs, the UK
Has a fine democratical way:
It's 'one person, one vote'—
A good system, you'll note.
Every Briton has his or her say.

Although Deus is Latin for "God",
Why "in nomine Dei"? It's odd
That the Lord of dimensions
Can't banish declensions
Imposed by some ancient old sod.

What two states have a quirk that's the same:
Just one consonant sits in each name?
O, i, a can be found,
'Cause those vowels resound;
Not an e nor a u is to blame.

The old gent had been given the eye,
So he gave it the old college try.
But her come-on was phony,
Just bar dare baloney.
Pop's patient; he's still standing by.

With her lovers, my wife keeps in touch
Via letters and phone calls and such.
"The first thirty-nine
Weren't so bad," I'd opine,
"But this fortieth guy is too much!"

Jimmy Dean, though deceased, still lives on
In a song he co-wrote: "Big Bad John."
He made country hearts throb,
Gave a Muppet a job,
And sold sausage from here to Taiwan.

Acantho-'s from Greek and means "spine."
It's a prefix and helps to define
Plants with thorns/things vertebral
(Used by folks most cerebral),
And tree surgeons think it divine.

Arrhenius knew a reaction
Would hasten if heated a fraction.
"I deduce some relation
With E-activation,"
He said, with profound satisfaction.

When a catalogue's dubbed raisonné,
It's a Frenchified way you can say
Annotations exist,
In an index or list,
Of the works that will be on display.

Though this strip never had me in stitches,
Broom-Hilda fills one of those niches.
While not witty or striking,
She's good for those liking
Cigar-smoking, man-hungry witches.

There are granules of proteins right there,
In the outermost endosperm layer
Of a seed, and they're bound
To the vitamins found
In that place, but the chickens don't care.

"Kitchen countertop's cracked," said the critic.
So, in shopping for something granitic
That would cover the block
With pastel fine-grained rock,
I obtained and installed the aplitic.

Distasting (disliking) cars slow,
A snail bought a Jag at a show.
Painting S on each side,
He took off for a ride.
People cried, "Look at that S-car go!"

Both a flame and a year fade to ember.
Observe, at the end of December,
A word that's implying
The year's flame is dying
But burning enough to remember.

Aristarchus of Samos declared
Geocentrists had possibly erred.
When all's said and done,
Might we orbit the sun?
Is there infinite space? No one cared.

He thought that his words were acidic
When he lectured in south Chappaquiddick;
So right for that hour,
Being fresh, sharp and sour,
But in truth they were dull — just bromidic.

Threats in H-bomb-linked crises we got
Through the Cold War—mistrust was our lot.
Arms reductions by name
Were achieved all the same.
Ron and Gorbie stopped cold turning hot!

I cherished my pet axolotl;
I found him, one day, in a bottle.
I tugged on his tail...
"Oh no!" did I wail:
"I've rendered my lizard acaudal!"

Freedom's march by protestors was led
When Britain's democracy bled.
From my comfort zone why
Should I march? No, I'll try
Writing letters to broadsheets instead.

Though my dive shop resembles a dive,
I've got gear to keep divers alive.
No, I didn't invent it;
I sell, trade or rent it.
And I stock all you'll need to survive.

If fermented grain mash makes you frisky,
You need not think the age statement risky.
Take a 12-year-old Scotch,
Wait four years and then watch:
The result?  Still a 12-year-old whisky.

Determinists say what's contained
In this limerick's been preordained
By the fates or whatever,
No matter how clever
My wording or how I've been trained.

A - V - A - X - T - S - K - Y - R:
Out in Iceland, this cheese is a star.
While its flavor I'll praise,
Though I've tried to for days
I just cannot pronounce it so far.

Our color sarn't's wife is a nag,
And she scolds him and says he's a fag,
But he's always consoled
(What a sight to behold!)
When he leads us while bearing our flag.

There is nobody, penny-wise, wiser.
He could work as a scrimping adviser.
He's a demon for thrift.
Even words get short shrift:
No econo is spared by this miser.

He writes music that orchestras play,
And conducts in a calm, graceful way,
But I'd bet all my PEZ
That our maestro Boulez
Gets upset when they call him "boo-LAY."

This is you if you hew to the view
That we've screwed up the world that we knew.
There can be no repair.
Buy a gun, say a prayer.
Clearly chaos is coming.  We're  through!

When you heard that the owner was dead
You moved in to his home in his stead.
Now the new legal heir
Finds that you're living there,
An abator; you're blocking his tread.

The housekeeper's friend NH3
Keeps dwellings bacteria-free.
Germs leave me alone if I
Always ammonify,
And so do my in-laws — yippee!

See Cupid's swift arrows bestow
Wondrous love; they set hearts all aglow.
May he reach in his quiver
And surely deliver
His arrow from bow to your beau.

When Pete, on the cliffs of Peninnis,
Isles of Scilly, and drunk (too much Guinness),
Fell down from the rock,
It was more than a shock:
The end of it all, it was — finis.

My girl's ten, but she's going on teen —
Getting nearer to grown-up, I mean.
These days no one denies,
Thanks to Internet's rise,
Kids age quicker from screens heard and seen.

As a pig, I was nearly forsaken:
Without the blue ribbon, I'm bacon.
Charlotte did me up big,
In her web, spun "SOME PIG",
Saved my hide, but she left my heart achin'.

Oh, don't throw your toys out your pram!
Yes, I treat all your emails as spam.
Hurt your feelings? Don't care;
I don't like you, so there!
Just accept that I don't give a damn!

Arame (that's seaweed, to you)
Can be stir-fried to feed a whole crew.
As a side dish with fish,
Some will say it's delish,
But tonight I'd prefer a fondue.

It was over before it began.
I snuck out when he went to the can.
Though I never could date him,
I didn't berate him
For trying to pass as a man.

Princess, this was a poem for thee,
My anonymous, great addressee,
Who lets no rhyme or meter
Dismay or defeat 'er,
Composing ballades hassle-free.

Don't respond to the troll.  That will lead him
To forum abuse.  We don't need him
Disrupting our fun.
If you see his posts, run.
His one aim's to inflame, so don't feed him.

The cottonmouth's mouth is pure white.
It's a sight that fills swimmers with fright
'Cause this snake likes to swim,
And your future is grim
If this moccasin chooses to bite!

Cap crucifix clutter creation?
Peg Protestant prop population?
Trick-trending truth tramples,
So seek several samples—
A valuable cross-validation.

When a color's chromatic, they say
It's defined as "with hue." Well, OK...
It's "a color with hue"?
I reply, "Whoop-de-do!"
(What they mean is not black, white, or gray.)

Said Blanche, a despiser of Trump:
"When he tweets or he speaks on the stump,
He's asinus ad lyram —
He lies! We can't hire 'im!
I won't vote for an ass, I'm no chump!"

By e-mail, e-missives are sent,
With an e-philosophical bent.
E-clectic, they're cabled,
E-lectric e-nabled.
E-gad, they e-never relent!

The monarch's the role I've assumed;
The previous king has been doomed.
He was not labeled mean,
Neither base nor obscene,
But persistently shabbily groomed.

I will cobble a cobbler from scraps
You can gobble in bowls off your laps.
To this crusty meat dish
I'll add veg if you wish.
If you're good, there'll be seconds — perhaps.

If crystals should split as a prism
Not only with verticalism—
Horizontally too—
Diprismatic will do
To describe such a cleavage or schism.

An achenium's one kind of breed
Of a fruit about which you may read;
Indehiscent (no split),
Single-seeded, and it
Is so bare that it's called naked seed.

Miss World's need to pee never ceases,
Hence global awareness increases.
But she's somewhat dismayed,
Since her major crusade
Is not diuresis — world peace is.

It's at sunrise that reveille's blown
And the skills of the bugler are shown.
With no valves to rely on,
He's forced to get by on
One set of harmonics alone.

A linguaphile, she has collected
Words she likes and considers neglected.
I suggest that you look
At her marvelous book.
With the language bug you'll be infected.

'Twas brillig, where mome raths were mimsy,
For Carroll, the master of whimsy.
A slithy tove curls,
'He is dodgy with girls',
But such gimbling gyre is quite flimsy.

My mother and I had this fight;
And I know for a fact I am right!
I am not going back
'Til she cuts me some slack—
Can I crash on your sofa tonight?

Miss Long's letter, a lengthy epistle
(Sharply critical, pointed as thistle),
Made the editor blink:
No, it wouldn't see ink.
In a wink it was binned like old gristle.

All my equities, company stocks,
I would once keep locked up in a box:
Now financials like these
Are on line. It's a breeze
And as safe, so they say, as Fort Knox.

Basic chutney's a south-Asian relish
Of vegetables cooks will embellish
With chilies and spices.
The consequent price is
A chutney so hot that it's hellish.

In the old days, a guy could comprint.
It means print alongside; there's a hint
There of ties that will bind—
If you willingly signed
Your own name to another guy's stint.

A wee child puffs a dandelion head,
And its seeds are dispersed, widely spread.
From this same basic word,
A dispersal's occurred
When a shooting-range target is read.

"I ain't never bin aimin' to hurt you.
You know that I'd never desert you."
Clem's words were like honey,
But Daisy felt funny,
So still she hangs onto her virtue.

It's from one of my favorite plays:
In the bosom of Arthur he lays.
Thus Sir John met his death.
So declares in one breath
Mistress Quickly—she butchers the phrase.

"This tartly red cranberry's very
Delicious in sauces," said Kerry.
"It's perfect with turkey —
And urine that's murky.
It's such a darned versatile berry!"

Joseph Conrad was obviously brighter
Than others as sailor and fighter:
Of Polish descent,
He learned English and went
Through adventures in life and as writer.

Let's elasticize currency now.
We'll make bills out of rubber, I vow.
Though today people holler,
"I can't stretch a dollar,"
They could with this money, and how!

In voting, a long time ago,
A black ball implied "anti", not "pro";
So you blackball (reject
From a group or a sect)
When you ostracize someone you know.

"I've been dealt a bad hand, God.  I'm fat,
I'm not smart, and I'm one ugly cat."
"Lose some weight.  Read more books.
In regards to your looks,
Listen, Kevin.  I'm sorry 'bout that."

You are doing your prospects no good.
The results, to your detriment, could
Rather quickly arise,
So more tact I'd advise,
To avoid being misunderstood.

Across from the sun in the sky,
There's a counterglow, faint to the eye.
It's backscattered light
(Due to space dust) at night,
When it's dark and the weather is dry.

Don't you spray me with that — don't you dare!
I just came in this shop for some air.
Now I'm covered with scent
And I'm sorry I went
Past that stinky concession-(sniff)-aire.

You're respectable, so, Mr. Hunt,
Our scheme's failure means you take the brunt
Of the wrath from those cheated,
Whose funds we've depleted.
That's why you're set up as our front.

Blackpool Sands is a family beach,
With the showers and snacks all in reach
But hang on, and don't panic,
The food is organic,
And recycling is something they preach.

In stilettos this season's bespoke;
On a catwalk I strut before folk
Who don't buy off the peg.
Damn! I've not shaved one leg.
That's my cover blown! Yes, I'm a bloke.

"That barmaid called Mabel," said Bert,
"Is the sort what's as common as dirt:
A foul-mouthed young hussy,
Who ain't none too fussy—
That's what I calls 'a nice piece of skirt.'"

A dieter, feeling laconic,
Drank gulps of an acid dextronic.
When the syrup kicked in,
She decried, "It's a sin!
I'm addicted — it's true, and it's chronic."

It's a problem I've battled all winter.
It might be my toner or tinter.
With my email, oh please,
Help me send out cc's,
Since the carbons won't fit in my printer.

Bruce sniggered, "Jeez, mate—that was funny,
To see that I would have paid money.
Can you do it again?"
I said, "Shut up!" And then,
"Help me get myself out of this dunny."

A pattern of planes in the sky
Keeps its shape as they come roaring by.
The formation of jets
Always gives me the sweats —
In my dream I'm the pilots' bull's eye.

Your ignition switch suddenly froze?
Are the contact points clean? Do they close?
If they properly meet,
Then the circuit's complete,
And you'll find electricity flows.

My arms—they won't wave! They just keep
Kinda hanging—refusing to sweep!
They're no longer alive!
Call a medic!... Oh. I've
Only rolled on them during my sleep.

In a cave or a mine, there's no light;
It's the same when you're cycling at night.
Where it's cold, dark, and damp,
The antique carbide lamp
Burns a flame that's amazingly bright.

Ben's painting shows bare-naked trees
Bearing snow on their branches. One sees,
A short distance away,
A small horse and a sleigh.
His frost piece shows Frost expertise.

A strong building within and without,
It's a citadel, blockhouse, redoubt.
It's a place of a sort
That is known as a fort:
That's the structure I'm talking about.

My wife is re-doing, with wicker,
From our bed to the locker for liquor,
But a basketwork range?
It's alarming; it's strange.
If she won't change her mind, I might kick her.

A beggar of fame and renown
Plied the byways of old London town.
Toss a tuppence his way,
He would hound you each day
Till he'd touched you for more than a crown.

If it ends in a  ?, one surmises
That in reading the piece, the voice rises,
So we know it's a query
(At least that's the theory).
Our language is full of surprises!

List activity stages to do;
List the time that each task will accrue;
Overcome lazy tendencies:
Note all dependencies—
Tasks, in their places, you view.

My neurologist firmly asserts
That my alpha wave cues no alerts.
I'm awake and at rest,
And this EEG test
Reads from 8 up to 13 calm hertz.

In lands where the chicle trees grew,
Sticky gum could be tapped, Aztecs knew.
Though still sweet and elastic,
Our chewing gum's plastic—
Ponder that, the next gumstick you chew.

A Luddite proclaimed in frustration,
"SUVs are the scourge of the nation!
Abominations! I yearn
So to burn, each in turn,
All the SUVs parked at the station."

I find limericks are always a flop.
Though with gusto they start at the top,
All my great expectation
Succumbs to frustration
Down here, when abruptly they stop.

Antibiotics will weaken
Or kill the bacteria seekin'
A host to infect,
To roast and deject.
So get to your doctor — stop freakin'!

Your proctologist called and he said
That they didn't find polyps. Instead,
As they rummaged around
Through the clutter they found
Miscellaneous crap—and your head.

It's a bit of a cheat, I confess,
To say B-T-D-T-G-T-S
Is a word! But I'm sure
That you've been there before
And done that, got the shirt too, I guess.

Use cellular concrete to build
The walls of your home, if you're skilled.
That avoids, at low cost,
Wasted heat that gets lost—
And you'll never feel painfully chilled.

While the others conjectured or guessed,
All the salient points you addressed;
Hit the nail on the head,
Left no doubt—not a shred—
Scored bang on with your plan. I'm impressed.

"First the bar near my office," says Dwight,
"Then my local is where I'll alight."
Diarticular tension
He calls this convention:
He's tight in two joints every night.

Jack got bopped on the head (with a crozier!)
By the bishop, who'd lost his composure
When he called Jack a brat
And Jack cracked, "Man, you're fat!"
Now Jack prays for a speedy wound closure.

Entomophilous plants require bugs—
Certain insects, not wind, birds or slugs:
Perhaps beetles or bees
Spread their seed, not the breeze.
Guess these critters deserve herbal hugs.

He assured them he'd guarantee growth
Or make good any loss to them both,
But the stock market crashed
After which, unabashed,
He reneged and went back on his oath.

A cornett? Spelling error, you think.
But it's not, I reply with a wink,
For unlike a cornet,
This one's wood, you can bet.
If in Germany, ask for a Zink.

He said, "Hey! Come and dine at my house,
Though the meal is bare-bones."  But his spouse
Really gives me a scare;
Would she really serve bear?
I would rather eat pheasant or grouse.

While travelling in England, Jane tried a
Large glass of a local-made cider.
She became discontented —
The drink was fermented —
And alcohol vented outside her.

Tides of winnowing vapours stretch tight
Scudding wisps between frail shadow's light.
Silent clamourings glow
Through Arcadian snow,
Give my pale abstract thoughts second sight.

When a don tells his wiseguys to kill,
He knows that they probably will
Do away with the thug
With a shiv or a slug.
Such procedures are run-of-the-mill.

When the genny went bad on my car,
Lights were flashing. I didn't get far.
A car will devour
Electrical power.
No charge means no go; no cigar.

He's the cat who would never demur
When the baby would pull on his fur;
He'd alight in her lap,
Settle down for a nap,
Close his eyes and contentedly purr.

The Flemings (they're Belgians) speak Dutch,
Which is spoken in Flanders as such
(Like in Antwerp or Ghent,
Where they may pay their rent,
And where French isn't spoken that much).

My new co-star is sure to beguile:
Natural equipoise, balance and style—
Debonair, even cool,
Till that edge made me drool.
He'll stop hearts with that devilish smile.

Stout Lord Cardigan led the wild thrust
To attack Balaclava or bust.
But a great price was paid
By that brave Light Brigade,
With too many mowed down in the dust.

This activity's much to my liking,
And it's easily better than hiking.
I'm employing my feet
Yet enjoying a seat
As I glide down the street—I am biking.

I used to have money—a barrelful.
Things changed; now my world seems more peril-ful.
And what's worse, I've got kids;
Since I'm now on the skids,
I've been wishing that I'd been more sterile-ful.

Early reading books; alphabet chart;
Pencils, paper, and paint-pots for art;
Tiny chairs, there's one each,
Plus a teacher to teach:
It's the classroom where schooling will start.

The mild, tasty, white farmer's cheese,
Made from curds of skim milk (if you please),
Will be usually soured.
At our house it's devoured,
Though an allergy makes us all wheeze.

Our sports club would like to confer
This award, and our members concur
That whoever's the winner
Must appear at our dinner—
That's why all famous players demur.

This detainment is lawful, amigo.
You must show them you're legal, Rodrigo.
Your complexion makes clear
You weren't born around here.
Step aside. I'm a white guy, let me go.

Emboldened, its greed never ceased;
So, this ogre continued to feast
On the small and the weak.
Will the donkeys soon streak
To a win? ("Grand Old PAChyderm" beast!)

Now and then, as I lie in my bed,
Half awake, I sense deep in my head
Raucous noises and light,
With a feeling of fright;
That exploding head syndrome I dread.

Hear Fred Flintstone in Daba? Go to
Southern Chad (they speak Daba); then you
Must engage in a search
For an abba in church,
And say, "Hey, abba, speak Daba—do!"

When you say my career is a sham,
It's that Auto-Tune software you slam.
For this fame, I've no choice
But to upgrade my voice,
'Cause I really can't sing worth a damn.

Our town's been bedecked by the snow,
And I love the white wintry tableau.
But enough is enough —
There's too much of this stuff!
I'll be first, when spring comes, to hello.

The cattle were tested, then scoured
In strong disinfectant and showered
With antibiotics
To calm one neurotic's
Concerns. (He's their tender, the cowherd.)

Two structures are both called Eustachian—
One, in mammals and creatures batrachian,
Is a tube in their ears,
While the other appears
In our hearts since, at least, times Noachian.

The lizard that's called callisaurus,
In the desert would never ignore us.
He would flee and he might
Show his tail, black and white.
He'd amuse and delight—never bore us.

My husband would give me no peace
Till I bought him a pint of cassis,
But I knew what would follow:
Consumed in one swallow!
Then he grinned and flew south with the geese.

If a Mycobacterium bo-
vis infection hits cows, they may show
Signs of bovine TB.
Buy a cure (it's not free)
Or just cull, cut your losses, save dough.

A best looker was Bess, yes, she was
With her shiny black fur, and because
She was slim, but not thin,
A black panther's small kin,
And had beautiful little white paws.

Though her dealing was sloppy and artless,
This chicane would undoubtedly smart less
If some other chump
Had declared hearts as trump.
Hell, my hand and my ex are both heartless!

The rest of our rhyme clearly shows,
In the garden, the Maid hanging clothes,
When a blackbird (now free)
From his perch in a tree
Swiftly swept in and pecked off her nose.

Many countries in Europe today
Keep the hours of their clocks set one way.
In the winter, you see,
They all use CET;
When it's warm, CEST holds sway.

Cytologic, this smear over here
Shows a red cell that looks like a sphere,
And the white cells look queer.
It's a new disease, dear;
I'll describe it and boost my career.

Noisy neighbors upstairs play CDs
On their boombox. Lord, stifle it, please!
Compact discs pound my head
With the music I dread.
My poor eardrums are pierced like Swiss cheese.

"Your apology's rather belated,"
Said the gal to a fellow she hated.
"Your delay makes me fear
That it isn't sincere—
You still had your hair when we dated!"

We're flying at speeds supersonic
By means of machines avionic.
If they go on the fritz,
It spells trouble: our mitts
Aren't that fast without aid electronic.

"Lads, 'tis risky to sail this old ship!
She's a camberkeeled jinx!" warned our skip.
"If the ship hogged and broke,
We'd be in for a soak.
Down to Davy Jones' locker we'd slip."

"Dysaesthesia aethiopica!" raves
Doctor Cartwright. "What's wrong with your slaves?
This mental disease
Makes them not want to please.
It's no wonder a slave misbehaves."

Our Arabian camel (one hump),
Seeing poor punctuation, will grump.
Our proofreading dromedary,
If we've not commaed re-
sponsibly, spits like a pump.

From the scaffolding ledge Bobby slipped,
But with harness and wire was equipped.
Dangling high in midair,
He kept cool, didn't swear;
"Look at that — he's Aplomb Bob!" we quipped.

I've got several ageable aunts
Absolutely addicted to dance.
Though all long in the tooth,
They seem graceful with youth
In Terpsichore's magical trance.

My donk has a face sorta goaty.
His gait is more bumpy than floaty.
He attempts every day
To get grain stedda hay,
And that's why he's called Donkey Oaty.

A catechist opens a mission,
But generates fear and suspicion.
His lessons on Christ,
Which might once have sufficed,
Are rebuffed by Islamic tradition.

Evolution: I've got it down pat.
It created both us and the rat.
It doesn't take sides;
If it works, it abides.
It's the ultimate pragmatist, that!

Far from home, on a holiday cruise,
And emboldened by distance and booze,
I had Gigi with Kat,
Then androgynous Pat,
And I won't have to hear my reviews.

Something crazy goes on when this weed
Is mixed up in an animal's feed.
Cows may eat just un poco
And still become loco,
Vaqueros and cowboys concede.

No, you cannot play hooky from school.
No, you cannot break every last rule.
Well, you can, as you know,
But please don't, 'cause it's so
Sophomoric to act like a fool.

Vinicultural vying took shape.
Welch's workers were watching, agape.
There, at last, was a truce
Between "jelly" and "juice"—
They had found a concordable grape.

The appropriateness was in question:
The audience booed the suggestion
That the Lion King's roar
Was a burp, nothing more,
Since he suffered from bad indigestion.

To a shop in the mall I am heading
For the dress that I'll wear to my wedding.
It's a beaut, white as milk,
Made of angel skin silk,
Waistline pinched, with the skirt gently spreading.

The jailed gunslinger Billy the Kid
Said he'd robbed Sheriff West and then hid.
He relayed, with a sigh,
The bold sheriff's goodbye:
"Catch you later," he'd said. (And he did!)

Other horses were clearly outclassed
As they turned and came thundering past.
Kelso surged to the lead,
And kept laying on speed,
Legs galloping blurringly fast.

"Well, now that's a coincidence!" came
Her response upon learning the same
Spiny shrub that was worn
As a crown to adorn
Jesus Christ is a thorn with His name.

In Colossians, St. Paul the Apostle
Said that God is supreme and colossal.
Those with different beliefs
Caused a bunching of briefs
For the bald, apostolic old fossil.

Had my buildings been built on a stilt
Far above the alluvial silt
On those plots that I've gotten,
They'd stop going rotten,
Like most other buildings I've built.

'Cause of harsh puritanical views
Via blue laws, we're down with the blues.
I strongly object
To a Sabbath respect
That enforces a ban on all booze.

You started your life as a cell,
As an ovum (an egg with no shell),
But a sperm came along
With a smile and a song—
Now you're paying your taxes—ah, well!

That empiric (unqualified hack
With no obvious curative knack)
On the hospital's roster
Is just an imposter
Whose license needs lifting, that quack.

"It's short, as such science terms go,
But it's show-offy. Use words we know.
Why not just call it thread?"
"We say filum instead,
Because bug butt bits aren't used to sew."

A man falls in love with a crab.
"You're so fabulous, Abby!" he'll blab,
But his gab can't convince 'er;
He'll grab for her pincer.
She'll wince and cry, "Call me a cab!"

"You're aliterate—never liked reading;
All your brain-furrows badly need seeding.
Your books are all shut...."
"I'm a literate what?"
(What remained of our chat involved bleeding.)

The galop from Orphée aux enfers
Sets the cancan, a dance with French flair,
For a line of loose flirts,
Kicking high in loose skirts,
Wearing nothing but powder down there.

Altitudinarians often have flights
Of fancy: their names up in lights.
They're the types who aspire
To climb ever higher.
Their goals are the highest of heights.

Bought a lottery ticket with Fred.
"If we win, we'll go halfies," he said.
Now he hands me this pottery,
Says, "Here's your allottery."
So I whomps him upside of the head.

You need to be bailed out? You oughter
Not sail if your boat takes on water.
I've got a tin can,
But if I was you, Dan,
I would just take her back where I'd bought her.

When great tennis star Margaret Court
Won her first Aussie title, the sport
Chose to give her a brolly.
Though she might have cried "Golly!",
Will it rain on my reign? was her thought.

In this drawing I made of our sister,
The ink and its color are bistre,
Transparent and brown
From her eyes to her gown,
With a stain where the artisan kissed her.

In Montana, folks don't cry "Hosanna!"
At the sight of this fruit: dwarf banana.
They're not found there at all.
Grown in China, they're small,
But to those who enjoy them, they're manna.

As we reach the extent of our age,
Should we burn? Not go gentle, but rage?
Or should we instead
Take this chapter as read
And turn over the welcoming page?

In the lounge, the convention begins:
Slapping backs, swapping handshakes and grins.
Seeking Babbitts? You got 'em.
The conventioneer: spot him?
There, festooned with his badges and pins.

The one missing from Grace, out of place?
The drunk sot with the beery-eyed face.
He is now not allowed
To hang out on our cloud.
It's the third time he's fallen from grace.

Growing older and older, I yearn
To hold on to the facts that I learn.
All the terms I forget,
Names and places, are yet
Just abeyant, until they return.

We were landlocked and dry as could be.
We decided to issue this plea:
"You're our last, best resort;
We need use of your port
And a corridor through to the sea."

Private Johnson was killed in the war,
Yet his pay still arrives as before.
This is dead-pay, a crime—
Someone ought to do time!
Such corruption we ought to deplore.

If you want a great deal on some teal,
There's a deal to be had back in Deal.
If you deal with this trade,
A steal can be made,
If you deal the cards right — spin the wheel.

It is hard to write verse on the pelican
With no belican rhyme, likewise helican.
"Who can make me," you cry,
"A nice sea bird on rye?"
I'd say maybe some strange Saint Kitts delican.

Cruciverbalists learn crosswordese,
Filling puzzles with words such as these:
Dies irae and busto —
Less-used words that you must know
To solve crossword puzzles with ease.

This chain store's a 24/7
Convenience for people—it's heaven!
Buy magazines, candy,
Or Pampers—it's handy
To shop at a 7-Eleven.

As a tot, I tooled 'round  on a trike;
Now grown-up, I can zoom on my bike.
Through stalled traffic I zip
At a quick speedy clip—
Need no gas and I don't have to hike.

Diltiazem, AKA Dilzem—
Folk bring me prescriptions, I fills 'em.
If they ain't polite
Well, then sometimes I might
Give 'em strychnine instead, which just kills 'em.

Stress OEDILF as this dictionary's name
(Please, no OEDILF: that's just not the same);
Though it's counterintuitive,
Here we must do it if
Ever we hope for acclaim.

At an arms trade I pulled off today,
I sent shiploads of guns on their way.
I got plenty of gold
For the weapons I sold;
I'd sell bombs to small kids if they'd pay.

What is sought by the English top brass?
