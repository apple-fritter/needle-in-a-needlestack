The relevant lines are:\n\n\"Some folks might think cranberry glass\nIs for fruit of the cranberry class.\nBut it's glass of deep red, \nWith a gold sheen, and said\nTo be sought by the English top brass.\"\n\nCranberry glass is a type of glass that has a deep red color with a golden or yellowish sheen or tint. The limerick implies that despite what some might think, cranberry glass is not actually made from cranberries, but is a decorative type of glass that is prized or sought after by elite or upper-class English people.",
