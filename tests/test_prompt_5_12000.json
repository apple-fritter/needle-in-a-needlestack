He is characterized as being \"asinine\" - which means stupid or foolish. \n\n3. He is also described as being a \"gas bag\" who is \"flatuous\" - implying his ideas are full of hot air and empty rhetoric.\n\n4. The narrator treats Uncle Wayne with \"disdain\" - showing a strong dislike and lack of respect for his ideas.\n\nOverall, the limerick portrays Uncle Wayne's ideas as being foolish, stupid, and unworthy of serious consideration. The narrator clearly has a very negative view of his uncle's thought processes and opinions."
