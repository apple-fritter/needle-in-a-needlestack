This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible. 



Some people get off on aspersion
And revel in animadversion.
They're carping, acidic.
Each one is a critic.
Relax! Take a summer excursion!

Said the patent clerk, "Barman Al, ein
Großes Bier in my favorite stein."
"Right away, Bert," spoke Al,
"Hear you're moving on, pal."
"Ja, physics will be my new line."

The animal hospital's vets
Can do wonders when caring for pets.
My dalmatian looked dead,
But they fixed him instead.
That's as good as this doctoring gets.

Uncle Wayne always gives me a pain.
His ideas are vain and inane.
He's both asinine (fatuous)
And a gas bag who's flatuous.
I treat the old fool with disdain.

They couldn't get in if they tried;
The tall fence signalled "entrance denied."
Safe within the exclosure
There'd be no exposure
To scrumpers — kept strictly outside.

When tides flow, anemones clash:
Polyps creep in a real-estate dash.
Swollen tentacle-things,
Acrorhagi with stings,
Drive invaders away with the lash.

We have reached a delicious accord.
I can keep all I've managed to hoard.
When it comes to divorce
I don't ever endorse
Generosity one can't afford.

What's the role of the cardiac muscle?
It's to hasten the bloodstream; to hustle
Each red or white cell
Through the system, pell-mell,
Thus promoting a speedy corpuscle.

May this blessing bee more than a platitude
(Honeyed words which bee-dew you with gratitude):
Why not bee like the flowers?
They don't bee-ver for hours,
Yet they bloom with attractive bee-attitude.

It's been talked of, imagined, yes, chased,
Called dangerous—finally traced.
Now I'm hungry to catch
Me a nice bandersnatch
For my stew-pot. I long for a taste.

Stream-of-consciousness writing? Explore
What the twists of your brain have in store.
Eat your lunch waggin' tail
Of a Czech in the mail —
Seren-dippity-do you want more?

A punk rocker named "Deathhead" will dress
In an ugly goth style to excess.
Plus tattoos you will see
On his face, but to me
His badassery fails to impress.

Each new Catholic priest used to get a
Peculiar hat, a biretta,
Upon ordination
As a mark of his station:
Too clerical — now they know betta.

Cooed his mistress, "My darling, please, chill.
Twenty grand—is that such a big bill?
What's your bank account for
If not Monsieur Dior?
It's the price of my licence to thrill."

Why are robots in films always men?
Fighting, killing, unthinking, and when
Sometimes fembots are seen
On the silvery screen,
They're just sex objects, time and again.

"I tell you, you're indigent scum!"
The supplicant asked him, "How come?"
"You ask for, all whiny,
My on-the-fritz heinie:
You bum a bum bum, you're a bum!"

A martyr to bold eccentricity,
He believed he could use electricity
To put some more life
Into sex with his wife. . .
Their grave is of tasteful simplicity.

In the shower and kitchen, no doubt,
You do not want the wet to seep out.
It'll mildew and crack
The whole floor, front to back.
Do not grouse! Seal your tiles with grout.

Since the pear will apparently squeal,
The apple's pre-paring to deal.
She'd been bruising a melon,
Which makes her a felon,
Unless she can win on a peel.

Said a puzzled hermaphrodite, Tex,
"I oppose separation by sex.
Anti-desegregation
Compounds my frustration.
Choosing men's room or ladies' can vex!"

The museum girl seemed so sincere.
"Pharaoh's mask! Get your own copy here!
(This cheap plaster casting
Won't be too long-lasting
But) Rates as a great souvenir!"

Crib-biting's a terrible vice
Seen in horses; it carries a price.
If your stallion or mare
With arched neck sucks in air,
You might seek some preventive device.

In Hebrew, his name is Abaddon,
This king that the patchwork folk had on
The throne of the pit
Into which you can't spit
To the bottom, and boy! He's a plaid 'un.

"Such corkiness! What's its locale?"
Asks Corrina, a guest and Cal's pal.
Cocky Cal's Cornish wine
(Ordered cheaply on-line)
Tastes to her like a sewage canal.

Doggone it — he did it again!
Dog (not Dag) has escaped — don't know when.
(I doggone it, will say,
When bad Dog gets away,
But dagnabbit when Dag bolts his den.)

"That's all, folks!" is carved on the stone
At the grave of an actor well known.
Why this epitaph choice?
When alive he gave voice
To some friends I have never outgrown.

"A bus is for everyone, dear.
In Latin that's omnibus. Clear?"
The late Rosa Parks
Could have made these remarks
When she told James F. Blake, "I'll stay here."

At the oil field, the driller's been crowing,
"Discovery well's up and flowing,
All my trials reversed,
And it's only the first.
What's that smell? That's my bank account growing."

The offense is stuck in a rut.
Their quick pass rush is kicking our butt.
Play selection is lame,
And we're losing this game.
What we need are some draws up the gut.

You're infectious, not up to a chat?
I'll buy flowers—although, failing that,
I could opt for a plant,
Like I got for my aunt,
To leave outside your house on the mat.

When defining a word, so I'm told,
Don't disguise it. No, better unfold
What to you seems so clear
By marking it, dear—
Use the tags that will make it look bold.

Jeanine Deckers, Dominican nun,
Sang the song "Dominique," which would stun
Many teens when this screwy
Tune topped "Louie Louie" —
A crime! — when it reached number one.

The dancers were starting to go.
The dance band was playing too slow.
Says the leader, "Play cut time,
It's wiggle-your-butt time,
Take off!  Twice as fast!  Let it flow!"

The genus called Alcea covers
All the hollyhocks (cherished by lovers).
Larvae feeding on them,
Under leaves, near the stem,
Will be plucked off by birds—maybe plovers?

There were no flowers left, which is why
This small cactus was all I could buy.
So for you, turtledove,
Here's a gift like our love:
It'll grow even when I don't try!

Robert's assay's arrived, and he's crowing:
His claim's where there's blossom rock showing.
That oxide-stained quartz
Very clearly supports
Bob's faith that his future is glowing.

To tell if two men co-exist
Put this test at the top of your list:
Are they both in 3-D?
Good! Now time still will be
The wrench in the relative tryst.

A clever clogs isn't enhancing
His chance of a turn at the dancing
When he shows off his wit;
To a Miss it's no hit,
For a smartass is never entrancing.

On his deathbed, Dad asked me to check you, Trix,
So he named me the single executrix
Of his will. He took care
That you'll get your fair share—
Bit by bit, so the money won't wreck you, Trix.

Errol's instincts can verge on the feral,
Which is likely to land him in peril
With his current lass Pearl,
Who's one gem of a girl—
Though she's not a choice morsel like Beryl!

"Please, bring me some water!" I cry.
"I'm feeling completely adry!
Fetch a glass or a cup;
Hurry, please, fill it up...
Oh, and add a few jiggers of rye."

My dark, checkered past came to light
When a cop pulled me over one night.
Her computer spewed torrents
Of outstanding warrants
For me: nineteen thefts and a fight.

It's a place where one's wine one can store,
Or a basement beneath the ground floor.
Though oft dark and dank,
We have cellar to thank
For that musical phrase, cellar door.	

Here's the broth, and the way that it looks
When prepared by a panel of schnooks,
Who so thoroughly boiled it,
They thoroughly spoiled it.
Perhaps there were too many cooks.

I read "dish elm" and "bright, bloody red,"
And thought, "Let's carve a platter for bread!"
But who knew elm wood shrinks?
And who knew elm wood stinks?
Or dishelm means "exposing the head?"

"I find sorting a terrible chore.
It's abhorrent, a bother, a bore.
I deplore it!" said Madge.
"But I've picked out the dradge,
And it's here: the inferior ore."

Compensative pride? Her life scheme
Is to live out a movie-star dream.
She extols her own roles
And looks down on the proles
To make up for her low self-esteem.

This fabric is heavy. It's made
For work clothes of durable grade.
Purely cotton or mixed
Fiber, guzzling is nixed—
Don't think you can drink cottonade.

Paparazzi will pester the fameworthy:
Intrusive photography's shameworthy,
And one cannot deny
That for poor Princess Di,
In her death, they were certainly blameworthy.

On a wet winter's day—quite mundane—
At the bus stop, I stood in the rain.
Then this wonderful fella
Said, "Share my umbrella."
Now we're married, and so we'll remain.

I remember the day that she left.
There were tears streaming down to the cleft
In my trembling chin,
As I never had been
So discouraged, disheartened, bereft.

"To be dumped by that rat," cried the bride,
"Is a thing I could never abide!
He will pay! I will sue
For divorce, naming you
Corespondent — his bit on the side."

All this limerick writing is fun.
I have already finished line one.
You can parse it with ease,
You can pass if you please.
I don't mind as this limerick's done.

To blend is to mix; here's a "viz.":
Variations on missus 'n' miz,
And in many a word
That from strangers is heard—
So, from blending, yore dialect's riz.

It grows in America's west:
Bigleaf maple, the tree I like best.
In the spring this big fellow
Sprouts blooms—fragrant, yellow.
Its heaven-blessed nature's expressed.

My lawn is a major disgrace,
What with car parts in every spare space.
My home's ugly as sin,
With the roof caving in.
Scream my neighbors: "Please fix up your place!"

Heard of Mad Frankie Phelps? What a villain!
He's a consummate expert at killin'.
When he flashes his knife,
Say goodbye to your life
And hello to the hole you'll be fillin'.

If a gallstone is stubbornly tucked
In your gall bladder's sole cystic duct,
It will back up the bile,
And the surgeons will smile,
As they love to find stones that obstruct.

The boss gives me grief on my job
Of riveting armour. I sob
As I stand, sweating blood,
While attaching this stud
(Or this boss) that behaves like a knob.

I'm a drinker, that's easy to see.
I love wine when I'm out on a spree.
Though my words may be slurred,
I can always be heard
Singing, "Little old enophile me."

Says Yahweh's top scribe, "Don't be shy.
Make that line on revenge really fly!
Since 'a tooth for a tooth'
Doesn't tell the whole truth,
Add 'an eye for an eye,' Adonai."

We hail to the president—chief—
In the hope that his tenure be brief:
That he'll do little harm,
Then retire to his farm:
Cincinnatus's civic belief.

"You'll reveal all your thoughts when you drink,
So I'll ply you with wine," said the shrink,
"And it might well produce a
Tongue just that bit looser,
And then I'll find out what you think."

When a ship is preparing for sea,
Just before casting off from the quay,
The Blue Peter is flown,
A flag, colours well known—
Blue and white, representing the 'P'.

A warm chair: that is where babies sprout.
Father told me — that's how I found out.
At that bit of a chat's
When I learned from him that's
Whereby I came to be brought about.

I think maps by Mercator are swell.
When you study a map, you can tell
How the world is arrayed,
Every nation displayed,
Though with globes you can roll them as well.

It was Alcock and Brown first of all
Who accomplished a very long haul.
The Atlantic was crossed,
Yet their record seems lost
Since it's Lindbergh that people recall.

There are little black ants everywhere
In the garden, and sugar's their fare,
Where they live with their queen.
Keep your home sparkling clean,
And they'll stay with their cows in their lair.

The campsite was rocky and hilly:
I knew that to camp out was silly.
'Cause sleep in a sack
Is not good for my back,
I awake with an ache — and I'm chilly.

Colonel Vincent was faithful in life.
In the army temptations were rife,
But his colleagues observed
He committedly served
God and country, his children, his wife.

An examinate? Never, not me,
'Cause examined I don't want to be,
For the first ruddy question
Will cause indigestion
To quite an unheard-of degree.

He wasn't just one of the guys,
And I felt like a warrior's prize.
Rippling deltoids and pecs—
He seemed ready for sex
As he carnally studied my—eyes?

"No appearance, M'lud!" It is clear
That the client is elsewhere, not here.
His essoiner's excuse
Is, I fear, little use:
"Er, the dog ate his bus fare." Oh, dear.

In Indian cooking, a pot
That is used in the kitchen a lot
Is the handi, a dandy
Utensil that's handy
To make many foods, cold or hot.

Jane left John for their dear old friend Clem.
Jilted John found a photo.  Of them.
He cut out each face
(He left not a trace)
To dispersonate, blot and condemn.

Having seashell valves equal in size:
Equivalvular — that's no surprise.
Your face is bemused;
Perhaps you're confused.
Thinking vulvalar? Fine, roll your eyes.

"You've got agminated glands." I felt looped
When my doc said those words, and I drooped.
"If they're massed in my bowel,
Should I throw in the towel?"
"No, the word merely means that they're grouped."

Fishing pearls? Fighting bulls? Then you may
Go and sing all the songs of Bizet.
There's a gypsy named Carmen;
She is wicked but charmin'
As she leads a poor soldier astray.

A Byzantinist studies the past
Of an empire doomed not to last.
His quest for the story
Of Byzantine glory
Brings tales of great riches amassed.

Geographic relates to geography,
Photographic pertains to photography,
Demographic? Demography!
Hydrographic? Hydrography!
Pornographic refers to pornography.

I'm a fisherman, hating my role,
And leaving the life is my goal.
So, a deal with the devil:
I cheat him! I revel!
I hope he's enjoying my sole.

Blimps are windscreens for mics.  They are there
To reduce pickup sounds from the air.
If you have a dead cat,
Wrap the blimp thing with that.
(You don't need the whole cat, just its hair.)

Like burglars that strike in the night,
Insurers won't pay for my plight;
I am loath to report
That I'm going to court:
Bereft if I cannot be right.

Since the battery died in my truck,
By the side of the highway I'm stuck.
I've got no signal flares,
So cars pass, unawares—
With no lights, I'm quite hidden. Well...

All the senators' voices sang out;
Near-unanimous "ayes" left no doubt.
They so clearly had lent
Their advice in concent
That the bill was thus passed in a rout!

So how is your earthbank today —
That big dirt pile of rock, soil, and clay
For some reason you save?
Is it fame that you crave?
Better stop, or they'll put you away!

A head filled with nothing, they say,
Is in danger of drifting astray.
See—your braincase is full,
So that gravity's pull
Stops your cranium's sailing away.

While Jason (without golden fleece)
Was strolling about ancient Greece,
He asked goddess Athena
Among the verbena:
"Please guide us in war and in peace."

Once, in Rio, and flaunting bravado,
Swapping coins for a local cruzado,
I then entered a store
That sold fresh fruit galore
Where I purchased a HUGE avocado.

While a blinkard's a person who's slow-
Witted, stupid, obtuse, so you know—
I no longer will use
Rusty nails, pins or glues
For my hat on the days the winds blow.

The rock star would like us to hear
His antidrug speech, loud and clear:
"Just stay sober and clean!
(It's you kids that I mean,
Because I snort cocaine and drink beer)."

Would the acid (carbamic) be missed?
Here's its name on our glossary list,
But the stuff's hypothetical
(Yes, I mean theoretical):
Just its salts and its esters exist.

"Author's Proof" in the publishing trade,
"Advanced Placement"  for grades that you made,
And "As Purchased" in cooking
Are all ways of looking
At A.P. and how it's remade.

That's a first-day-of-issue cachet
And it's postmarked, of course, the same day,
Conceived and designed
With this issue in mind.
Is it rare? Don't get carried away.

I'm illiterate; books are a pain.
I'm dyslexic as well, so it's plain:
I can't read.  Oh, why can't I?
Besides, since I'm anti-
intellectual, who needs my brain?

Do you hanker to start on the c's?
Have you got a cool limerick on cheese?
Well, don't get in a state;
There's not too long to wait,
Now we've broken the back of the b's.

I watch your Olympic ski race,
See you crouch down, then leap into space—
A geländesprung—wow!
Now you're moving, and how!
Just make sure you don't land on your face.

"That embroidery's bright," cautioned Basil.
"You have sure found a way to bedazzle.
If you fret that fine dress
It will soon be a mess
And get worn and reduced to a frazzle."

To excel, you must make your own way.
Find your path, do your best, come what may.
Give it all of your heart,
And complete what you start.
Worthy feats will outlive feet of clay.

Though a wall may be cheap when less thick,
It might fall were it not for this trick:
Every three or four yards
There's a buttress that guards,
Reinforcing, while using less brick.

A cylinder might be a bin,
Or a jar, or a pole, or a tin.
With a circle each end,
The whole profile's a bend—
And the best kind hides biscuits within.

It's claystone we're here to assay:
Sedimentary rock made of clay.
Not like shale with its strata,
But hard clastic matta,
Fine-grained in a uniform gray.

Beurre noir is the stuff that is found
In the pan when some butter is browned,
While beurre blanc is a sauce
That if fed to your boss
Brings promotion the next time around.

My pals paid a stripper a fee
For my bachelor bash, and since she
Proved so awesome while bedding,
I canceled the wedding.
I'm footloose and fiancée-free!

As a dyed-in-the-wool epicurean,
I enjoy that odd fruit called the durian
From a tree (genus Durio).
It's more than a curio—
So large it could feed a centurion.

Not foreseeing the gold he would strike,
The Big Bopper stepped up to the mike
And, with voice loud and strong,
Set a phone call to song —
"Hello, BAby...you KNOOOW what I LIKE!"

'Keep my laws,' promised God, 'and be blessed.'
Only one people did, not the rest.
But the spotlight is glaring;
It must be quite wearing,
Being constantly put to the test.

A contrivement's a plan, or design,
Or invention. So, here's one of mine:
It's called Beer Drinker's Dream,
An alarm that will scream
When the level's too low in your stein.

It is part of my everyday chores:
I deliver to offices, stores,
And small businesses—but
As they sometimes are shut,
They have drop boxes next to their doors.

A cryoscope measures how hot
For a solid to melt, but that's not
All its use—for it sees
Just how cold for the freeze
Of a liquid (in case you forgot).

Helping out is a rule Cubs obey:
Making beds, clearing dinner away,
Taking on a new chore.
As it states in their Law —
They should do a good turn every day.

Every flight has a prefix — a code —
On the number the airline's bestowed.
CX is specific
To Cathay Pacific:
And so into Hong Kong we rode.

Call my colorist—give him a try
When the hue of your hair makes you cry.
He won't cut, perm, or style,
But he will make you smile
If you go when you just want to dye.

Body-surfing's a cheap thrill at hand
At the ocean. Ride waves. Understand?
Stretch and stiffen your torso
Like a surfboard, but moreso.
You'll end up with a suit full of sand.

The blue capelet my grandmother wore
Didn't come from a big, fancy store.
She had knit it by hand
And I thought it was grand.
These short capes aren't in style anymore.

The girls got together today
And cattily chatted away.
No one got up to leave
'Cause each knew she'd receive
The same treatment, and be the next prey.

At times, we must all take a stand
In a crisis that forces our hand.
We can't pass through this life
Without woes, without strife,
But a failure, though sad, can be grand.

This yellowish liquid adds savor:
Acetoin's buttery flavor.
It's in apples and butter,
And trash in the gutter,
And it's breathed by a cigarette craver.

Twenty-eight of us live on a bus.
Lack of privacy's seen as a plus.
As our family grows,
We get closer, God knows.
Disconnectedness? Hell, no—not us!

A diligent fellow named Hyde
Tried and tried, tried and tried, and then tried.
"Excessive adherence
To blind perseverance"
Was the certified cause when he died.

If your last name is Fletcher, I'd guess
That an ancestor had some success
As an arrowsmith. You
Can tell volumes, it's true,
From the surnames that people possess.

There's a jump coming up, I can see.
It's a double, so timing is key.
The steed I'm atop
Must clear both with no stop.
Glad the horse does the jumping, not me.

A gelding's a castrated horse,
Or a donkey or mule. Of course
The result of castration
Is major negation
Of equine hormonal-fuelled force.

From Scene 1 to the ultimate curtain,
He could mesmerize us—that's for certain.
He would be my first choice
For the sexiest voice,
And I miss him like hell—Richard Burton.

A breech presentation is rare
And can lead to a breach or a tear.
The breech is the part
Of a baby whose start
In the world comes when buttocks meet air.

Is a mannite-like shortage your plight?
In the silver fir's needles you might
Find a method for staving
Your mannitol craving:
Controlling your abietite.

"Think the law might become your life's journey?"
Posed a musically gifted attorney.
"Don't give up the travail;
Squaring Justice's scale —
Ups and downs — asks as much as did Czerny."

Chez Jacques was a great place to dine;
We could even provide our own wine.
Maître Jacques said "Okay,
But there's corkage to pay:
That's a 'bring your own bottle'-type fine."

You're familiar with chess, you're au fait
With this wonderful game, so you say.
But I just wonder why
You put coffee and pie
On the board (like a tray) and don't play.

A poor biomathematician
Was regretting his market position.
Through a rosier lens
He'd pre-counted his hens,
But his eggs hadn't come to fruition.

FMDoug: Gotta leave on assignment.
Filipinews: Is this ur resignment?
FMDoug: No. Hold still,
Guys! I vow that I will
BRB to undo ur confinement.

If you wish to lose weight, please begin
By not eating out—just eat in,
Using recipes that
Use less sugar and fat.
Double chins will dissolve—you'll grow thin.

War was hell, but what's worse? Its cessation.
Our defeat's brought complete subjugation.
Now we're bidding adieu
To our sovereignty, too:
Debellatio's swallowed our nation.

Ancient churches would sometimes possess
A 'bridal door'. Why? Can you guess?
Each pair (not yet bedded)
Outside it were wedded,
Then went in, so the priest could say 'Bless!'

With Medina's inspired revolution,
A religiously fair Constitution,
Joining Book tribes forswore
Their old blood wars of yore —
A solution to squelch retribution.

The goddess of love, Aphrodite,
Wearing naught but a Phrygian nightie,
Asked the king of Dardania,
"Are you man for my mania?"
Anchises replied, "Well... alrighty."

To assure you've a healthy prognosis,
After tissue is lost by necrosis,
Small centrioles dwell
Deep inside of each cell—
Organelles that will help in mitosis.

While blackening snapper for lunch,
I wanted to kick up the punch
With chilies and spice...
But I added them twice!
Tongues will scrunch when we munch, I've a hunch.

As a strip, what sets 6 Chix apart
Is just who does the writing and art.
Taking turns day by day
Each of six has her say
Serving humor and wit a la carte.

No pronouncements or premature oratory:
This experiment's purely exploratory.
Just testing the waters,
Injecting your daughters
And sons in our secret laboratory.

What a navel encounter last spring
Occurred between daddy Ben Sing
And his daughter, Sue Ann,
All about a young man
And her new belly button gold ring.

Old Aesop, a classical gent,
Had a clear allegorical bent.
You could learn from the words
Of his critters and birds
And discern what his parables meant.

I'd been trimming these trees every day—
Tiny bonsai that fit in a tray.
Yelling "Ten thousand years!"
I'd attack with my shears,
Til I'd trimmed them completely away.

A rocket or spacecraft, I've heard,
Like a plane, can be labeled a bird.
And I guess UFOs
Could as well, although those
I must say are completely absurd.

Computers use double precision
To calculate complex division —
It takes 64 bits.
The term also fits
For a Siamese twin circumcision.

As an editor, Janet will cluck
When confronted with bangs. Some are stuck
Where they just don't belong!!!!!
Take 'em out. Makes it strong,
So you get much more bang for the buck.

Anaclitic describes Virge and me.
His programming skills are the key
To our website's success,
I am quick to confess.
Without him, just where would we be?

Once we jumped from our jungle location,
Walked as bipeds in hunters' formation,
Learned to kill and to cook—
But the closer we look,
There's no progress in civilization.

When those CME credits are due,
And you still need to gain quite a few,
It might take an all-nighter
To make things seem brighter
And all of those credits accrue.

I am zooming along, as I like,
But a bear's over there, on a bike.
And, as a disheart'ner,
His radar-gunned partner
Has clocked my top speed. (Just a spike).

For watching your neighbors undressed,
A Cassegrain telescope's best.
(Better spy from a spot
Where you'll never be caught;
You could possibly face an arrest.)

She's an aquaphobe—scared of the water—
So won't use the bathtub I bought 'er.
That's fine, though; her reek
Makes her lose hide-and-seek—
I can smell 'er before I can spot  'er.

From lager I tried to protect her,
But the bar finally had to eject her.
The beer led to fights
And then out went the lights!
She's a gal who can't drink amber nectar.

A cellist lamented, in Phrygian,
"Alas, life is certainly Stygian!
Before my Manhasset
I sit on my asset;
None see that I'm so callipygian."

"Two names for one plant group? That's cluttered.
Hate to change. What to do?" Daisy muttered.
Please, don't be unnerved;
The old name is conserved,
And Compositae still may be uttered.

Pennsylvania's well known for its "Dutch"
Who are mostly not Dutchmen as such.
Local Hildas and Hermans
More likely are Germans,
Though tourists don't care… very much.

To sad outcomes I'm often resigned.
(The blown mind in room 9 comes to mind.)
When you're shot in the head
And just this side of dead,
Adios you can kiss your behind.

An investor should see a red flag
At a firm with the closely held tag;
A minority share
In the ownership there?
They hold power; you're holding the bag.

My chrysoberyl ring—how it shone!
What a rare and a beautiful stone
My guy Chris gave to me.
Then we parted and he
Took it back.  Now my treasure has flown.

Mrs. Staver made candy treats flavoredly,
And her students enjoyed the sweets savoredly,
But she saved up the best
For her pet, and the rest
Were all jealous of Tess, treated favoredly.

Mr Johnson, our prof, is okay,
But his thoughts tend to wander away.
Absent-mindedness hits
Sometimes, smashing to bits
All his plans for the lectures that day.

Democratically, we gave permission
By ballot for that politician
To win the campaign.
Have we voted in vain?
Why'd the other guy get the position?

Though Theseus will die if he strays
In the labyrinth's tortuous ways,
Still a thread guides him through
On the path that is true,
For the clew is the clue to the maze.

Atalaya is more than a house
Built for Huntington, Anna and spouse.
It's a watchtower, Moorish,
Seen by some—perhaps boorish—
As unpleasin' and reason to grouse.

Do your dry-as-dust fingers defeat you?
Did that Body Shop saleswoman cheat you?
If your skin makes you dither,
Put amandine thither—
Though if you're a swordfish, they'll eat you!

We all wonder how David is able
To reside just downwind from a stable.
The breeze brings the smell
During mealtimes so well—
How the hell can he sit at the table?

The eclipse year's too-simply defined
As when sun, moon, and earth are aligned
And eclipse season's here.
Some religions revere
Such a time as divinely designed.

Ancient Indian cultures are found
In many an Illinois mound.
In Cahokia's dig
The discov'ries are big;
There the bones and the potsherds abound.

Drink l'chaim! Let's break out the booze!
We just heard the incredible news
That our baby's engaged!
(Which just means that he's staged
In the childbirth position he'll use.)

He's no fantail; his sparse-feathered rear
Is prosaic. I see that from here.
A mere working-class pigeon,
He struts with a smidgen
Of pride, and coos with a sneer.

Apoenzymes must always combine
With their cofactors, or, down the line,
Things will go topsy turvy.
That's how you get scurvy;
Eat citrus whenever you dine!

In the twilight, he started to pray
For more daytime to finish a fray:
"Sun o'er Gibeon, STALL!
Moon o'er Ajalon, CRAWL!"
Captain Joshua's prayer saved the day.

My girlfriend will sweat, which can tend,
On those really hot days, to offend.
A deodoriser might
Help me feel less uptight:
Her BO drives me right round the bend!

The coach said my kid has to quit
Since he drops every baseball that's hit.
There's no way he can play
Until I find a way
To obtain a corbiculate mitt.

If your church has an altar that's fit
To have something placed frontwise of it,
Like a cloth or a screen,
The antependium's seen.
But I won't pose a pun on "The Pit".

Though the NFL strikers were mocking,
The thespian stand-ins came knocking.
You could tell from the start
When a play fell apart,
They would blame its demise on bad blocking.

"Sure, it's hazardous duty!" Sarge cursed—
Looked so angry we thought he would burst.
Since not one volunteered,
We were forced, it appeared
To draw straws to decide who'd go first.

When imagining fanciful things,
Try to picture some buffalo wings.
Then forget flying beasts
And think fried chicken feasts
Cooked up spicy — one's appetite sings.

Their army's admoving our fort,
Charging hard, and the time is now short.
All the gates have been shut.
It's my ad—move your butt.
One more point and we're clearing this court!

He approached with a wolverine leer.
"How I long for your body, my dear,
Let us go to my pad."
She said, "Never, you cad,"
But was thinking, "What's wrong with right here?"

Cross-reacting agglutinin lumps
Nonhomologous microbes in clumps.
Having antigens bound
In a mass, docs have found,
Helps them study a virus like mumps.

I'm so sad your whole life is a mess.
Dog died? Let me share your distress.
Neither lover nor hater,
I'm a trained consolator.
Pay in cash, or I couldn't care less.

The old double-pan balance scale's gone;
My new digital scale is turned on.
This is now my sad fate:
I must give honest weight
And my customers no longer con.

An achievement age, teachers will state,
Is a benchmark that's used to relate
How your child will progress
As life's tasks they assess:
Walk by one, count at four, swear by eight.

Woodrow Wilson said, "I've got your back,"
So Carranza moved troops on our track.
Pancho Villa was smokin'
Since accords we had broken,
So he launched a cross-border attack.

In Alice's afternoon dreams
(And so slickly in Grace's, it seems),
Lives the Dormouse who's sleepy,
Whose comments seem creepy
Since treacle and drugs are his themes.

It's a brief, abrupt burst, as of light,
Or of joy, or of wit, or of fright.
It's some hot breaking news
Or a bulb that you use
On a camera to make a scene bright.

As you enter the room, expect this:
Works of art on display, and pure bliss.
It's a gallery where
People linger and stare,
And are slowly seduced by The Kiss.

Mention ark, Noah first comes to mind.
'Twas his boat that saved two of each kind.
Next it's sacred law's chest,
Or perhaps it's known best
With a cap., where Bill Clinton's enshrined.

Through the heather the cateran rode
On a dark winding path, with his load
Of the booty he'd taken.
His nerves were quite shaken,
Since the law found his highland abode.

Hand-to-hand combat is tough,
And no weapon is ever enough.
Soldiers once used a broadax;
It wasn't a flawed ax,
And swinging it wasn't a bluff.

As confessed, "We did doggedly slog
At Online Philological Blog.
There's no getting around —
Your word hounded out hound.
Etymologists find it a dog."

Cajamarca: a place in Peru
With high altitude; dry climate, too.
Its cheese and hot springs
Are just some of the things
That make me want to visit, it's true!

Analysis studies and deals
With the limits and functions of reals.
It's a calculus class
That the nerdos all pass,
But is murder on normal schlemiels.

Over criminalness I obsess;
Won't be bribed by illegal largess.
You have wrongs to redress
And I'll see you confess;
I don't care if it's under duress.

Kim  the dog-lover chortled with glee
At the savory chow he could see:
"I won't eat puppy lips
Or some dog's bony hips—
It's the paws that refreshes for me."

The old gent had been given the eye,
So he gave it the old college try.
But her come-on was phony,
Just bar dare baloney.
Pop's patient; he's still standing by.

Californian nights on the shore
Find those ray-finned fish (spawning) galore.
There the eggs in the sand
Wait ten days 'til a grand
High-waved tide sweeps them seaward once more.

Ahead of our schedule?  Could be!
(...By the time that we open up "Z.")
There's a chance, I contend,
That the alphabet's end
Will be reached late in spring '23.

After long weary hours at the stall,
The thought of a pint comes to call.
So long as we've scads
(An abundance) of brads,
A jolly time's certain for all.

If a "heart-healthy" meal is your wish,
Try our Albany beef—it's delish!
So you won't be surprised
When it comes, be advised
You'll be dining this evening on fish.

In disasters, the ones left alive
Cling to hope that some aid will arrive;
And there's realisation
That wild desperation
Leads people to kill to survive.

You insist you deplore her, although
You're mistaken. And why is this so?
Well, deplore is for things,
Like your wife's weekend flings,
But the person herself? Sorry, no.

She left you her house. Auntie May
Made you happy like no-one could say.
Then your pleasure diminished,
For the deal wasn't finished,
And estate duty you had to pay.

An inventor who thought he was smart
Made a cake pan with no middle part.
It was little adored
Till it won an award.
That's how Bundt cakes, it seems, got their start.

The imposing and stately old sage
Distinguishedly stood on the stage,
But his speech came out jumbled;
He stumbled, and mumbled,
And stopped when his eyes left the page.

I'm painting my house, as the walls
Are now peeling—I know it appals.
If I add coloured powder,
The lime wash is louder;
Then colour wash neatly enthrals.

To Obama, we feel a connection.
We give him our love and affection.
Every wrong he'll make right.
All the world will unite.
It's akin to the Lord's resurrection.

As he's hurrying past on the boat,
She's aware of the brush of his coat.
With the contact, this miss
Now imagines his kiss,
And she stifles a gasp in her throat.

"A sea water colour displays
In a stone that is precious," it says.
Tell me how can we choose
'Twixt the colours and hues
For our ewage, bright blues or slate greys?

The councilmen, all aldermanic,
Are driving the townsfolk to panic:
"These women who revel
Are serving the devil!
Assail 'em or Salem's satanic!"

An afflux of blood to the head
Filled olden-day doctors with dread.
What we'd call a tumor,
They'd call too much humor
And solemnly order you bled.

She's the mistress of fibbery, that one:
Every line is a lie, and a fat one.
Her pitch: "Bored with the present?
Your truths grown unpleasant?
Crave a fabulist? My mama begat one."

My sister gave birth.  It seems Sally
Was depressed and unable to rally
When she found, from his chart,
That her newborn son's heart
Had a patent foramen ovale.

Epicritic: such nerves can assess
Tiny pressure change. Add s-i-s;
t-i-c gets the flick—
Epicrisis: "when sick,
It's a secondary crisis." Oh? Yes.

By passing this solemn enacture,
Loyal allies, PM, we've all backed ya.
It's the Don't Wipe Me Act
That has canned (banned, in fact)
"PM's Crap!" (loo roll brand) manufacture.

At the end of the wood, where the brook ended,
Stood a cast iron gate that was bookended
By a cop on each side.
I saw nowhere to hide;
That's the place where my days as a crook ended.

To a hermit, a cloister was shown.
As a home 'twas proposed as his own.
"Amongst monks cenobitic,
I might cell with a twit. Ick!
I'm better off living alone."

The act of enduring can be
Pretty hard on a young 'un like me.
I have practiced abidance
Without any guidance,
Becoming an orphan at three.

Spiky flowers top stems four feet tall,
Brightening dark muddy woods in the fall
With their cardinal red;
"Smoke their leaves," it is said,
"To achieve a tobacco-like thrall."

Neither lie with nor even embrace
Her. She wears an epalpebrate face:
Her fair forehead's plucked bare.
She wants wooly bears there.
A bald brow is a blank, barren place.

The age of the king posed a hurdle,
But the queen proved impressively fertile.
Now the realm has an heir
Who's suspiciously fair
(Like the locksmith who fashioned her girdle).

Conacre, in farm country, meant
That a fieldhand or laborer spent
Part of income he got
To grow food on a plot—
Feed his kin while his earnings paid rent.

My grandson, the drummer, of whom
I'm so proud, makes a loud "crash, bang, boom"
When he practices drums,
So that nobody comes
Without earplugs inside of his room.

Fred and I are frequenters of inns.
Every day we will stand on our pins
At each bar, with a glass
To our lips. We surpass
Other clients: the booziest twins!

Darjeeling that's cold makes her cross,
So I cover the teapot and toss
Her a come-hither glance.
I'm athirst for romance,
So I'm cozying up to the boss.

Make sure every i's dotted, t's crossed,
When computing an actual cost.
You can't use an estimate,
Or worse yet a guesstimate.
Do this and your cost will be tossed!

You see crocs in the water: a float.
That's the name for their group, please take note.
But on land they're a bask
And your primary task
If you spot one: stay very remote.

It's the hype that you hear in advance,
Or deposits you see when you glance
At the sink or the tub.
Get a sponge, now, and scrub.
Will the buildup all vanish? Fat chance!

An art fair exhibiter, Nash,
Left his paintings and fled with a dash.
(Art's not all he'd present
To a gal in his tent.)
The police found the guy in a flash.

I'm a certified country-bred youth,
Just a clodhopper, rough and uncouth.
Lacking polish and charm,
I'm at home on the farm,
Drinking moonshine—not gin and vermouth.

Business profits will never come free —
Knowing who's spending what is your key.
At the keyboard you tap,
Writing code in ABAP;
Pull reports out of SAP with R/3.

Gentle clemency, mildest of weather;
Softest breeze, lightest brush of a feather;
Wispy clouds crossing high
In a luminous sky —
At our ease, you and I walk together.

When he speaks, his words cause me to shrink,
And his nastiness drives me to drink.
He caustically pokes —
Then he says they're just jokes;
I think I should sever this link.

When I step on the clutch in my car,
I can change from one gear, with no jar,
To another at need
To adjust to my speed
As I travel both near and afar.

Derivations are used to explain
How those mathematicians obtain
Their results so arcane
That they drive you insane,
Or cause infinite pain in your brain.

I've been feeling, well, dumpish today—
Can't say why, but I'm less than okay:
Disconsolate, cross.
Damn it, here comes the boss!
Guess I'd better keep plugging away.

Though deep in the marshland I wade,
That will-o'-the-wisp starts to fade.
It was visible, plain,
But the image lost gain…
So I'm drowning, and also betrayed.

When employed in an agency shop,
Even non-union workers can't stop
Being stuck paying dues
That the union can use
To remunerate guys at the top.

Dishabille and still reeking of gin,
She raced out to the curb with her bin.
"Am I late for the trash?"
The man grinned in a flash:
"Not at all, lady.  Hop right on in!"

Said Barnabas, "Surely John Mark
Is the man to go with on our lark?"
"The Pamphylian shirker?"
Said Paul, "He's no worker—
He's the last man with whom I'd embark."

"The irregular shape of this spot
Means it's blotchily made, does it not?"
"Ooh-ooh-ooooh!" "Mr. Horshack?"
"That ink stain by Rorschach
Looks just like a birthmark I got."

Make a stab — is the back kept posterior
In position because it's inferior
In appeal to the front?
Or for bearing the brunt
Of the wounding from motives ulterior?

My wife has a penchant for taking
Her cold cream and mixing and making
A paste that she'll place
On her neck and her face.
She likes smearing and coating and caking.

There's a shrub that is bearberry-bearing
On which I have taken my bearing.
It grows near the Bering
Strait; down I'm fast bearing,
My bare behind there I'll be baring!

This critic's of minor repute;
His empathy's much too acute:
The awful soprano
Who shrieked through "È strano!"
He called "just minutely argute."

Those observers who work on the Hubble come
To develop strange thoughts that can trouble some:
From the Big Bang till now
Things expanded, but how?
Is the universe string? Or just bubble gum?

In the movies he's aching to star,
Though his acting is not up to par,
So he constantly hustles
To build up his muscles;
He's made it to beefcake so far.

I'm concerned. Our fertility rate
Continues each year to abate.
Tribal elders now warn:
If few babies are born,
Then extinction may well be our fate.

I remember when John became Dr. —
He got mad at a patient and sr.
She'd pilfered a pessary
For a fashion accessory;
He came from behind and cold-cr.

This stuff dextranase helps clean your teeth.
It hunts dextran that hides out beneath
The old ivory tines,
So the build-up declines.
It destroys your gross dental plaque sheath.

As children, we strive to conform
To our peers (that's the gender/age norm).
Yet we have to obey
The adults as a way
To survive: any port in a storm.

In my hot yoga class a cool swami
Teaches asanas known as Bikram. He
Does the Cobra with ease,
At a hundred degrees,
With a mind-bending spine twist to charm me.

It's a crystalline base in a gland
With five nitrogen atoms at hand.
This adenine goo
Has five hydrogens, too,
And five carbons that finish its strand.

He was caught with a mort of false dice.
Some were loaded, and others bore twice
Either pips high or low.
Those dispatchers would show
At most three, at worst four. Vile device!

It's a numerological name
Of old Basilidian acclaim.
To Jung, it was force,
Both the void and the source—
His my-gnosis-beats-yours kind of game.

He told me, "Butt out of my life,
'Cause I'm up to my eyeballs in strife.
I can't take any more!
Get your ass out the door!
You are acting too much like my wife."

Once I broke a small branch from a tree
Which then screamed and threw apples at me.
I suspect that the cause
Was The Wizard of Oz
I'd just watched while imbibing Chablis.

Come with me, and I'll show, if you dare,
The darkness that feeds my despair.
Don't be fooled by my smile:
I am here for a while,
But my soul has no hope of repair.

Though a candlelit dinner might soften us,
Will the smoke cause the waiter to cough on us?
No, the opaline milk
Of that light, like shot silk,
Makes us glow in its gloaming cymophanous.

Gyp hated the Jews, so they say,
And "republican" wasn't her way.
She wrote novels galore,
Least a hundred or more,
But her books are not read much today.

The trouble with bitty wee mouses:
They insist on invading our houses,
Where they nap for the day,
But then happily play
And carouse with their minuscule spouses.

I am finally getting my wish
With this interesting bright-colored fish.
Of the cowfish I test,
Seems the longhorn tastes best:
Surf and turf all wrapped up in one dish!

I just had a thought that I'll share:
"Stay a While" — should a Scottish group dare
Do a cover, appalled
I would be were it called
"Bide a Wee."  By the way, do you care?

You're certain to cherish and love it—
Most bricklayers think the world of it.
A trowel you pick
For cement. For a brick,
Use a bolster: a clear cut above it.

I'm full-whiskered and -bearded.  Folks stare
At my flocculent face filled with hair —
Lhasa Apso hirsute.
Kiddies whoop, "Ma, a brute!"
But I don't give a hoot (nor use Nair).

Courtly bailiffs escort you to jail,
For your failure at raising your bail,
Where your jailors from hell
Let you bail from your cell
Once a day, just to empty your pail.

With a poker opponent who's vicious
You had best ante up when he wishes.
Should you hold back your due
Better flee to Peru
Or you'll wind up asleep with the fishes.

Excerption involves the selection,
After lengthy and careful reflection,
Of a part of the whole
That advances one's goal—
Representing the work to perfection.

On my rose bush, a brace of convergents
Are fighting an aphid resurgence.
As these ladybugs feed,
They are just what I need
For American Beauty's emergence.

"You're too cheeky by far," I was told.
"You are really too forward, too bold."
"I'm impertinent, true,
And quite insolent too—
All in all, quite a scourge to behold."

Obsolete though it be, it's among
The most flavorful verbs in our tongue.
Saying bing for "to be"
Is like music to me,
As I conjugate: bing, bang, and bung.

Though I thought that the coughing was tough,
'Twas pneumonia that made me feel rough.
While I near bought the farm—
I sloughed through without harm
After soughing "enough was enough."

When conducting, I have to keep guard
For the hoodlums who slip from the yard
And then board for a ride
With no ticket.  They hide
In the club car, and catching them's hard.

Here's a nice piece of wood you can whittle,
But don't let it dry because it'll
Be easy to break,
So whatever you make
Will just crumble or flake. 'Twill embrittle.

We have limits on what we can bill
To our client for grading that hill
For his roadway to town.
To keep labor cost down,
We'll employ the technique cut and fill.

A British new ager named Dusty
Would bristle when labeled a crustie.
His Theosophy creed
Formed when all he would read
Were old books by Blavatsky (quite musty).

Their great passion for sushi expressin',
'Shoppers' flock to this dock for their fressin'.
Fishers carve up their catch;
Seabirds watch, then they snatch,
At their favorite pelicatessen.

As in basket, but not as in bag;
As in flagpole, but not as in flag:
A two-syllable word,
Not daft, more absurd —
More wiggle or waggle than wag.

"Ted tells tales," Sadie said. "He's a fabler."
"He's a liar!" cried Larry, a labeler.
"Don't call him that name,"
I said.  "Ted's not to blame."
(What a shame that I'm such an enabler.)

What is crop milk? Here, read all about it:
Baby pigeons cannot live without it.
By mom, it's secreted.
Thus babies are treated.
Are cookies served also? I doubt it.

Any kid, playing fast, running hard,
Minds the clothesline that's strung in the yard.
Thus an arm to the neck
Is to clothesline, a check
That in football, at least, has been barred.

In pieces she came to our shore,
To her spot by the great "golden door."
Once on site and emplaced,
She was quickly embraced —
Her promise too firm to ignore.

Our Yugo's exhaust pipe was broke.
Clouds of smoke round my wife made her choke.
I gave her a gas mask.
She gave me a crass task—
"Just fix the damn car, you dumb bloke!"

The most diligent person I've seen,
He will work like a bloody machine,
Always gives of his best,
And attacks life with zest—
The epitome (trust me) of keen.

On our crest, with a roo Aussies team you.
You taste best when we stew you. We deem you
Supreme. You're a bird
Who can't fly (how absurd),
Yet we love and esteem you, O emu.

"It is freedom," said Ben, "that I want
From my master," and so, nonchalant,
He strolled off the plantation
And crossed our great nation.
Now this contraband lives in Vermont.

"This African land's a utopia,"
Say people who love Ethiopia.
The rose (but not zinnia)
From old Abyssinia
Is part of its grand cornucopia.

Said my wife, with her eyes scrunched up tight,
 "That flash is so blindingly bright!"
 Said I nervously, "Uh,
 Is it safe to say 'duh'"?
 "Yes, but then you'll get nothing tonight."

A seductress has feminine thighs,
And a sculptress ain't one of the guys.
Every actress you know
Is a woman, and so
Could a buttress be what it implies?

Someone's raided my lab, and has stolen
That piece of McGee's descending colon
That his surgeon suggested
Be studied and tested.
His bowel had bled and was swollen.

At a beer blast, among all the schmoozers,
Were some guys drinking whiskey — what losers!
So I said, "Chug some beer!
Or you're out on your rear;
For at keggers, there cannot be boozers."

Though it looks like brown sugar's refined
Somewhat less than the common white kind,
There is no taste that's fairer
Than sweet Demerara.
Is that song by the Stones on your mind?

What is fan-tan? There's more than one game
That is known by that assonant name.
One's a card game, and—jeez—
Seems the other's Chinese.
To win money is both the games'  aim.

Now the dirt dikes are crumbling; the walls,
Too, are tumbling; there's blame because all's
Going to hell in a basket.
Fiddle-dee and a-tasket!
Kinda late for our waking-up calls.

We ain't drove there since heaven-knows-when;
We got spooked by  the sheriff back then.
Bogus tickets define
Crossing his county line.
And the nerve! He smiles, "Y'all come again."

Well, the Bible presents a good story —
It's absorbing, exciting and gory.
But unless you've the fever
Of a real true believer,
You would not think it true a priori.

Eurovision — if you have a song,
There's a contest where nothing goes wrong!
With each fling ding-dang-dong,
Every boom, bang-a-gong,
We've a hit hip hooray, bing-bang-bong.

Though her "perfectly tuned choreography"
Used "all of the stage's topography",
The men wore no pants,
So, to critics, the dance
Was "a wanton display of pornography".

The American West is defined
By a series of peaks well aligned.
Adams, Baker and Hood,
These Cascades have long stood
With grace, by the ages refined.

MacTavish, that cadgy old Scot,
Drinks up shot after shot after shot,
Then starts making passes
At sweet bonny lasses,
Singing, "Ach, what a grand life I've got!"

The calidrids, typical waders,
Have sensitive bill tips: each caters
To digging for prey
That are buried away.
Busy sandpipers' beaks are invaders.

With fictitious reports, the new team
Tried to fool the reviewers. Their scheme
Truly didn't cut ice.
For their lies, in a trice,
They all lost their high ranks and esteem.

Cloth from fibre or yarn? Start to knit,
Although blokes might start squirming a bit.
(We don't like to be seen
Wielding needles) I mean,
Knitting fabric, we'd feel like a twit!

The unfortunate gambler confuses
His chances, so wagers he chooses
Defy all the odds,
Sorely tempting the gods,
So it's fate—in the cards—that he loses.

He had thought it might tickle her fancy,
So he tried chiromancy on Nancy.
Said he, "You'll have palaces!"
Said she, "Those are calluses."
His palm reading made Nancy antsy.

You've mastered, in charlady class,
The correct way of polishing brass;
The removal of stains;
And with glass, that the pane's
Other side's always cleaner. You pass!

A chirographist, expert was I,
With my handwriting praised to the sky.
My skilled hand was an art
And it set me apart—
Now computer fonts beat me, first try.

"I'll... just freshen up," says Aunt Mabel,
Looking ever-so-slightly unstable,
And everyone poises
For terrible noises
To follow her flight from the table.

The insurance I have is the worst—
No protection should anything burst.
When my roof blew away,
They declared, "We won't pay!"
That's the whole #*!%&#@ reason I cursed.

In the '50s, my ant farm was strewn
With those six-legged farmers, but soon
Came a change, right or wrong.
They all grew their hair long
And established the first ant commune.

I tap sap from the trees in my dells.
In the tree cells—there cytosol dwells.
It's a cell sap they've got;
I would sell sap but not
Sell the cell sap that dwells in their cells.

A creaser makes lines that you go by
When you're stitching—neat guides you can sew by.
You'll have fewer mistakes,
And you'll find that it makes
All the hours of the day seem to flow by.

There's a need to inform Santa's elves
That more toys should be up on their shelves.
Does any one elf own
A land line or cell phone?
If so, we can tell them ourselves.

Am I female or male?  It's not clear —
Could be either or both: genderqueer.
Yes, it's true: I've two exes,
One each from both sexes.
Guess I'll try a cross-dresser this year.

We grow wheat, an abundant variety —
Make a living through pastoral piety.
The scenery's charming,
The farming quite calming;
It's a great and agrarian society.

I won't change a "yes" to a "no".
Or go if I don't want to go.
Bloody-mindedness? Yes,
And I'm forced to confess,
I'm too stubborn, and doesn't it show?

Tick (a) if I rhyme, and tick (b)
If I properly scan, and tick (c)
If this poem defines
In precisely five lines,
Or if all of the above, just tick (d).

The newspaper, folded (that's bent),
Held dead fish (I could tell by the scent)
And a note.  Laughed a lot;
Some dumb gangster wrote not
"Shoes of concrete," but "shoes of cement".

The high school conductor displayed
Slim dynamics at Sunday's parade.
The softs and the louds
Wowed the marching band crowds,
But the mezzos did not make the grade.

Oh, the fairground's a fun place — here's why:
Each will feature a coconut shy
Where the prize is a goldfish.
Although not an old fish,
Before it gets home it may die.

I believe I've compounded and sent all
The pink inks to Jenn's Gentle Dental.
It was Geisel-I-Am
Ordered green inks and ham.
(Pause for praise to my muse, Atramental.)

What M-Webster announced was dramatic,
For it altered a word's sense grammatic.
See, they put the word they
Into singular play,
Making many a woman ecstatic.

When the bane of old age starts to strike,
Then the odds you'll forget things may spike.
You can pray it's not true
This will happen to you,
But they say that gray minds think alike.

A fellow who trotted the globe
Now sits in his house in a robe.
He fears open spaces
And dreads public places.
We call him an agoraphobe.

My limericks are being aestheticized:
Beautified, polished, poeticized.
My syntax I mourn
As to shreds is it torn,
And my slant rhyme is savagely creticized.

You lazy accidious lout!
This is it; pack your stuff and get out!
Such a layabout slob,
Get a life!  Get a job!
You're a loser beyond any doubt!

He's the backer you need to enchant
For the money—a loan or a grant.
When you're staging a play,
Get an angel, they say.
There's the devil to pay if you can't.

Chocolate syrup — a big gooey squirt,
And a layer of peanuts can't hurt —
But only on Sundae.
My doctor says one day
I'll croak while I'm eating dessert.

That the corpses were rotting was plain,
But the cannibals couldn't refrain
From devouring the dead,
Till cadaverine led
To the imminent rite of ptomaine.

These numbers secure similarity;
They help finding physical clarity.
A dimensionless number,
I dreamt in my slumber,
Would tell me what's wrong and what's verity.

Their meeting became an all-nighter
As they sought for a method to fight 'er.
Seems her house was of wood;
They decided they could—
With the help of a cigarette lighter.

We lade anthracite here at the slip,
And good bunker coal fuels our own ship.
Then the collier's crack team
Settle in for the steam:
Coal for China — one lonesome round trip.

Here's an edible frog for your lunchy—
I know you love something that's munchy.
I've peeled off the skin,
But I've left the bones in.
(If I hadn't, it wouldn't be crunchy.)

Borborygmus, herewith we apprize:
A gas bubble sound breeding denies.
You can't manage to squelch
When it's fated to belch
Or, worse yet, to escape twixt your thighs.

That's the stupidest picture you've made.
What a dumb way to fill in (that's shade)
Your dad's ugly fat head!
It's your mommy, you said?
Your art sucks for a kid in third grade.

Billy Bob said, "Hey, gimme a dope."
Is he asking for heroin? Nope.
That request, in the South,
Brings a Coke to your mouth.
(And that's all he's requesting, I hope.)

Having teachers so pious and nunnish meant
Hell to us boys with a funnish bent;
Ruler-raised blisters
From Catholic-raised sisters
Were cruel and unusual punishment.

A corbeille of apples and pears,
A corbeille of wishes and prayers,
A tisket, a tasket,
A corbeille's a basket
I wish I could fill with my cares.

I confess that it doesn't seem strange
That Obama has clamored for change.
I would love to comply,
But removing this guy
Is the change I would rather arrange.

This dismantling before it's begun
Delegitimizes all that we've done.
The act stands or it falls,
But at least have the balls
To allow it some time in the sun.

Cancer's use in a simile's wrong.
This is one place it shouldn't belong.
For no sufferer's spared
When its growth rate's compared
To the quote "sound of silence", in song.

A mild-mannered lawyer named Marty
Signed a contract, agreeing to party.
Counterparties then sued
As he'd acted subdued,
But had promised to come party hearty.

Ol' Grandpa avoided much strife
By steering folks' praise to his wife,
Disavowing all credit,
With a smile as he said it,
Aw-shucksing his way through his life.

We thought we would hike, for a lark,
In the Grand Canyon National Park.
It's around a mile deep,
And the paths were so steep
That it took us till well after dark.

The burden I carry is heavy,
And my job brings no tax and no levy.
I swear, on my oath,
I'll depone them, the both,
Then I'll sit in my home with a bevvy.

Swore the sailor "Magnetic" McGlinnick,
"I am (though a bloody old cynic)
Sure my compass will dip
At the point when my ship
Sails away from the line that's aclinic."

Don't worry—relax—don't be scared.
First, a rhyme (call it A) fits line one;
It's all right if you feel unprepared.
Then line two (also A) has its fun.
Things are different this time;
A new rhyme for line three
For convenience, this rhyme
And line four (call it B);
Has been captioned, for limerick-impaired.
Back to A for line five, and we're done. 

I'll watch out "For My Girlfriend," Louise,
Always driving as safe as you please.
This campaign is a plea
Called, for short, FMG,
Or in my case (Don't tell!) FMGs.

The unusual way I pronounce
Causes experts to bristle and pounce:
It's cacoepistic,
But still, they're sadistic
To call me an agnorant dounce.

Lulu Glaser, a lucky chorine,
Shone on Broadway at just 17.
Did she dream, as a child,
That the stalls would go wild,
Shouting, "Lulu! The great actorine!"?

When I said that I follow my nose,
Do I track it to see where it goes?
No, I follow a scent,
And today the stink went
To your basket of stench-laden clothes.

"In this helmet you seem to extol,
I have noticed—each side has a hole,
And what's more, they appear
To go over each ear."
"They allow you to hear. That's their role."

Since the study of cells never bores,
That cytology student explores
All the cells he can find;
And he hopes you won't mind
Stripping down while he's studying yours.

When he paid his devoirs to the Queen
The Marine was told, "Please keep it clean."
But he let rip a fart,
Which was not at all smart;
Now his duties are in the latrine.

The Pillsbury Doughboy (the louse)
Was taken to task by his spouse:
"Get off of your buns!
Make some dough for our sons —
Be the breadwinning man of the house!"

Re: The Old Derry Area Choir —
It's a name that will hardly inspire.
I feel like a chump
Every time I think "rump",
But their singing I have to admire.

"Hello" is a term I'd supply
If someone I knew should stop by.
But Australians would say
A curt phrase like "g'day,"
And yet have it emerge as "g'die."

I've no fear of the mean streets of Skokie —
I'm adept at concealed karaoke:
If I'm under attack,
There's a switch that I whack —
Then it blares out a loud "Hokey Pokey".

On the floor of the sea, your sub's stuck.
Now it's time to display Navy pluck.
Use the door on the deck,
When you exit the wreck,
To escape through that hatch. And good luck.

Poor Narcissus has fallen in love
With a face that could be his twin bruv.
He's no more on the shelf
Since he fell for himself.
Send him flowers, pink hearts and a dove.

Perhaps I should ban sweet Marie;
She's a dish too well stacked up for me.
Mr Cook's steamy daughter
Has me steeped in hot water!
She's eighteen and I'm past fifty-three.

Cupric sulphate's a chemical link
That will break in the presence of zinc.
Let 'em stew in the hopper
And out comes the copper —
Displacement reaction, I think.

My boyfriend just hasn't a notion
That his steadfast and faithful emotion
Is known by a name
That might make him feel shame.
People call it a doglike devotion.

Tired of coddling toddlers all day?
Then treat teens. They're an ailment buffet.
Adolescent theatrics
Add spice. Ephebiatrics
Tracks puberty's quirks underway.

Her appearance took all by surprise,
For her hair had succumbed to some dyes.
Her lush tresses, once red,
Were now turquoise instead.
Say goodbye to that Westminster prize!

When the style's alla prima, it's quick:
Just one layer of paint—not too thick.
For the artist, this try's
All he gets 'cause it dries
Very fast and the images stick.

Selling ice cream's the one thing I know,
And one guideline I learned long ago:
While demand will stay high
All through June and July,
There's no call when it's twenty below.

I saw, through that chintzy, thin curtain,
You were getting excited from flirtin'
With Fleur.  I'm quite sure
That your thoughts were impure —
And no mistake, Burton, I'm certain!

What is wrong with Uncle Wayne's ideas?
