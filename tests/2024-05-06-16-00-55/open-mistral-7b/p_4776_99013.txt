This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible. 



How shall you get the most out of you —
Exploit your skills fully?  It's true
You just love to recline;
So with that I'll opine
You'd best mattress-test, son — get paid too!

You can take this for what it is worth.
If your teen was a dreamer from birth,
Then just send him (no force)
On an Outward Bound course —
That will bring him, I'd bet, back to earth.

There once was a woman named Blake
Who complained that her stomach did ache.
The doctor came quickly,
Pronouncing her "sickly."
She really was quite a good fake!

Deserpidine, got from the roots 	
Of Rauwolfia shrubs (not their fruits)
Serves, as some sources mention,
To reduce hypertension
Or to tranquilize fidgety brutes.

De Chirico's colour and line
Were intense; his determined design
Was to paint the surreal-
ness of Turin. Most feel
The results are declaredly fine.

Ceremoniously, Sir John goes to bed,
With a drum roll and flags overhead,
Fires a 10-gun salute,
Blows his trumpet—toot, toot!
Or his wife plays his bugle instead.

I'm behind in my payment of rent,
And behind, to a sorry extent,
In what needs to be done.
Now I'm under the gun,
And my "get up and go" up and went.

The Arthurian legend has knights,
A magic sword, rivals, and fights.
But my flag's unfurlin'
For marvelous Merlin.
Can you picture him, bearded, in tights?

In Georgia I went with a date
On a rainy night (such was our fate),
To a bar; folks played pool;
The gal won. All was cool
In this lovely southeast US state.

At first we tried hard to beseech him;
Earnest pleadings, alas, failed to reach him.
Yet the problem remains,
He has left many stains,
And the only hope left is impeach him.

"TIG!" comes the shout, and the chase
Starts again, so we dash for that place
Where we cannot get caught,
And where time can be bought,
'Cause, in this game, the bench is the base.

"Fall out!" — leave the barracks and then,
In formation with other like men
And women, we'll stand
Till we hear this command:
"Fall out!" (Hit the barracks again.)

I'm a mole, and I live down below,
Watching seeds under ground start to grow.
All my life's geophilic;
Though dark, it's idyllic:
So peaceful, protected and slow.

These two golfers walk into a bar
For a shot and perhaps a cigar.
One's a pro, one's a vicar,
They went to drink liquor—
And now they're both way over par.

"I fell while evading some bees
And I scraped up my biscuits and cheese."
My expression looked pained,
So my daughter explained,
"That's just rhyming slang, Guv'nor, for 'knees.'"

"A corkscrew, a virus, a thread,"
My geometry teacher once said,
"Is basically chiral,
Like a knife, or a spiral,
Or scissors, or even your head."

This pusher would deal all he could
To the littlest kids in the 'hood.
Though by law it ain't right,
He was murdered one night.
(I suppose it was all for the good....)

As for ambi-, I'd like to expound.
At the start, it means "both" or "around":
"How's the ambiance there?
Lots of noise filled the air
With ambiguous ambient sound."

All my planning is gone down the loo.
Many hundreds of hours, adieu!
What I thought was so solid
Is feeble and squalid.
I hate when my projects fall through.

They went bouldering boldly all day,
And that night they collapsed in the hay.
As he held her, she groaned,
"I'm so tired 'getting stoned'.
Think you're getting your rocks off? No way!"

The French mullet is tasty, it's said,
And the home of this fish is widespread.
In warm waters it's found—
Ocean coasts—swimming 'round.
(It's not something you'd wear on your head.)

Motor racing's a battle of wits,
Needing courage and skill, although it's
Quite useless complaining
When black flagging's aiming
To signal you into the pits.

Black boxes survive and retain
Information on what leads a plane
To decide it won't fly
And drop out of the sky.
These devices, we trust, aren't in vain.

Every limerick writer stays fit
By reviewing for meter and wit.
And they'll keep coming back 'til
They've checked every dactyl,
The long and the shorts, bit by bit.

Abed's where you sleep in the night,
Unless you and your wife had a fight.
Then for you, it's the couch.
Next time don't be a grouch,
Just permit her to think she was right!

The effects of his job are severest
At home, on his nearest and dearest.
Careering away
In his workaweek day,
Is the fate of the lonely careerist.

"How I wish I could head in reverse.
No more birthdays.  My pains are a curse."
"As we age, we all ache.
We're not dead, for Christ's sake!
Most agree: that alternative's worse."

"You're a globe-trotter, travel extensively,
Go first class, so you journey expensively.
You travel so widely,
Isn't life wasted idly?"
"I deny that," he countered defensively.

A best-efforts basis may please
The investor: the banker agrees
That he'll manage the sale
Of a stock, though he'll fail
To provide any firm guarantees.

The pretentious old prof at the station
Complained of extreme fatigation.
His old word I admired.
Though he only meant "tired,"
Still it filled me with true admiration.

The people who form Susquehanna's
Town Council will not sing hosannas
To anyone who
Feels development's due.
These are folks who are known as BANANAs.

There once was a bichon frisé
Who was white with some patches of gray.
He was lively and small
And not very tall;
He enjoyed a fine bone every day.

My eye doctor said, "You've a stye,
But don't worry, you surely won't die."
Then he slipped with his shiv—
Should that flub I forgive?
Do you think I should turn a blind eye?

After drinking a large cup of tea,
There's an urgent desire to pee.
Diuretic caffeine
Flushes bladders all clean.
And so off to the toilet you flee.

When the wife showed her disapprobation
Of her husband's fall sports dedication
She ranted and raved
On the way he behaved —
A fanatic who loved Bronco Nation.

Said a wonderful circular curve,
"Ellipsoidal's your shape, dearest Merv—
So please straighten up, hon!
Let your foci be one!
I can't kiss an eccentric old perv."

The dressmaker, frantic, would shout
When the order was late getting out.
"Move your buns!" she would crack
To the seamstress in back,
As she busily bustled about.

"If concupiscence means what I think,
Then I've caught it,"  I said to my shrink.
"All it takes to inspire
These cold loins to catch fire
Is a friendly 'Hello' and a wink."

You emerge from your job (you've been fired),
Then espy a young maid brown-attired.
You rush forward to greet her.
She's guarding a meter;
Its sign reads in red: Time Expired.

With this wood carving, no hint of guile:
Check the marks of the blade and the file,
Which confirm it's hand made.
Sure, he's good at his trade,
And the facture shows folk art's his style.

Rash wanton!  Abandonly dance!
Be reckless, unguarded, and prance
Around the whole room.
You will lighten my gloom,
And I'll laugh if you trip on your pants.

"This vaccine is created quadrivalently—
Four virus types used, unambivalently.
It's as good as what you
Have been using for flu!"
"Sure they're both good," replied Tom equivalently.

A couronne is a loop that's crocheted
On the edge of a tassel or braid.
There are many in lace,
As embroiderers place
Them in borders of silk and brocade.

Partly based on the author's own life
In which child abuse may have been rife:
In the Dark (auto-fiction)
May well lead to friction;
More likely to child-rearing strife.

Ain't that smartlamppost camera just great.
It can serve up your soul on a plate,
Reading each facial part.
Oh, so state of the art!
Lo, behold the dark art of the State.

Decumaria barbara twines
Up our Warrington, Florida pines.
So, in June, when your Spec. you marry,
Be wed beneath decumary:
Fragrant hydrangea vines.

Our limericks commonly use
Some humorous ruse to amuse.
Still, it isn't so rare
That a verse will lack flair
And, when read, have you ready to snooze.

As a clown, Costard often amuses,
But in Love's Labour's Lost when he uses
"Honorificabilitud-
initatibus," will a dude,
Upon hearing it, think the fool boozes?

What's dysuria? A: Russian tea,
Or B: Feeling pain when you pee,
Or C: When you're sure
That his motives are pure.
Time is up. (Yes, the answer was B.)

A flood tide lifts up every boat
Causing egos to swell and to gloat:
"I'm riding so high,
How clever am I!"
'Til an ebb tide disgorges the bloat.

I'm chumming, provoking the fish
With some fabulous fish-tempting dish.
I'll use corn crushed in bread
Or some chopped salmon head;
They'll be primed for the hook, as I wish.

"Pipes are boring," complained plumber Cyrus.
"For a challenge I'm very desirous.
Carbon nanotubes? Cool!"
Now I've heard that the fool
Is installing a loo for a virus.

We'll be denning in snowdrifts ahead;
Lost our dogs and the number one sled.
So, to base camp, our cheers
As they quaff down their beers.
Ere the morrow we'll sleep with the dead.

In the distance the storm clouds had massed;
Soon a bank dumped its snow and then passed.
Will the plows clear each street,
Making snow banks to greet
Those commuters who'll bank they'll drive fast?

Campanology (bong!) was the bringer
Of doom, when a crumbling cross-springer
Fell (clunk!) from the vault.
It was nobody's fault,
But it left us with (ouch!) a dead ringer.

At the clinic, Diseases (Venereal),
I am told my infection's bacterial.
"It's a chancroid," they say.
That rat Hank's gonna pay!
Rodent bait will go great in his cereal!

In the Bible one Sampson elected
To sleep whilst, by him undetected,
Delilah, hair tweaker,
Then rendered him weaker
By cutting his locks — unexpected!

Like a winner, he bounds up those stairs,
While the music amps up and then blares.
He's won, he's the champ!
But Rocky's now gramp—
Let's see how his next new flick fares.

Next-door neighbors remarked, "What a shame!
He's been barhopping — out with a dame?
Though he's found the right block,
This just isn't his lock;
Guess development homes look the same."

Every Friday, my cousin enjoys
Going out, but she has to appoise
(Or weigh up) for the night
(As she's bi, it's her right)
If she's chasing the girls or the boys.

Uttered Rudy with perfect astuteness:
"This drink shows abnormal diluteness.
All the tonic put in
Drowns the flavor of gin."
But the bartender's answer? Just muteness.

Touch the keyboard and big bellows blow
Past tuned strings. Plaintive strains slowly flow,
So sad ... you can't scream a chord —
Schnell's big animo-corde
Breathes only anemic chords' woe.

You are seeking the meaning of bow-wow?
Even infants can point out a "wow-wow"!
If you're still in the dark
That it's dogs and their bark,
Maybe you and your parents should pow-wow.

With a kindness you might call exceeding,
The old lady's been going out feeding
All the local stray cats,
And the dogs, and the rats,
And the vampire bats. Now she's bleeding.

Voluntarily simple, a nut—
I just live with essential stuff, but
My lifestyle ascetic
Is good dietetic
Technique for reducing my gut.

As a rooster who used to have clout,
He's about to be beat in a bout.
Once the cock of the walk,
Now his squawk is all talk.
In the rout, he'll be chickening out.

On a ring or a chain made of C,
HO—|—H sits like twigs on a tree.
Carbohydrates are food;
In your meal they include
Starches, cellulose, sugar — fat-free.

I went sailing with Christopher Cross.
He declared, "On this ship I'm The Boss!
I'm Commander Supreme!"
To be Bruce is his dream,
Or as famed as Diana (Ms Ross).

Thomas Aikenhead openly said
What he thought of the Bible. This led
To a trial in court
For his blasphemous thought.
The young man then was hanged until dead.

"The gazintas," taught Mrs. Lurleen,
"Can make ciphering almost routine:
If I buy seven ducks,
And I pay 14 bucks,
What is seven gazinta 14?"

A cabin, among many things,
Is a place where romantics have flings
By remote country becks
Or on cruise-liner decks
(Oh, and pilots get one with their wings).

Arachnoid's an entry that tends
To confuse. What's it mean? That depends.
"Fibrous membrane" the Lord
Built 'round each spinal cord,
Or "resembling our eight-legged friends."

We heard Mom shriek, "For crying out loud!"
In the voice with which she was endowed.
We knew her frustration,
Impatience, vexation
Would keep us (a sec or two) cowed.

One night when the weather was nippy,
I caught the bus back from the chippie,
Ate my chips from the paper,
But, oh what a caper,
My cod piece I shared with the clippie.

Unprepared though she seems, she's done great.
Though ad-libbed, her responses have weight.
Young suburbanites get her;
Downtown, even better,
But she baffles the yokels downstate.

Here's my tale: A kid lacking in awe
Sprinkled soot in some socks, 'cause he saw
'Twould embarrass his parent:
Soiled feet shame inerrant
Pious footwashing Baptists like Paw.

That eel won't emerge, though you troll
Tasty bait on a line. Take a pole,
Baited hook at its end.
Now, my friend, just extend
Your brog to the eel in its hole.

Fanny's honeymoon plans were romantic.
"Let's drive eastward and see the Atlantic!"
By the time Dan confessed
He had headed due west,
They'd reached Pittsburgh, and Fanny was frantic.

Grand Admiral — that'll be me,
And of what? Of the wide Ocean Sea.
But Columbian fame
Reaches Harlem: my name
Is the same that adorns your degree.

"My faith can move mountains," said Jesus.
"That's the strength of our heavenly breezes."
Quoth Muhammed, "I'll raise you.
Allah's power'll amaze you;
Though the kuffars it greatly displeases."

Believers say, "Let us now pray."
Say atheists, "There's just no way!"
But not at all certain
What lies past life's curtain,
Agnostics interpret in gray.

Our lovely young foreign au pair
Tends our kids with her competent care;
  But when they go out
  With their mother, I shout
"May we now please begin our affair?"

A pre-noon salutation long gone
Is good morrow.  This phrase has a spawn:
When good morning took hold,
It was out with the old,
Which had then ushered in a new dawn.

I asked, "What is that strange-looking thing, Gus?"
"I'm not sure; Mingus called it a dingus.
This strange gizmo, this doodad —
Let's hope that it's true, dad! —
Some good luck will bring us, per Mingus."

Worried Wes, "This recession ain't funny,
And I frequently fret about money."
But his great-grandma Gertie
Recalled 1930
And told him, "Just deal with it, Sonny."

At a tiny Tasmanian college,
A marsupial maven named Hollidge
Inspects seven pouches.
"They're small," he avouches,
Thus flaunting his bandicoot knowledge.

The ever-so-talented Ripley
Could make cutting remarks very fliply.
That was then; this is now;
It's no longer a wow
To say people on crutches are cripply.

So you're planning on planting a flowerbed.
Well, make with a rake and hoe: plough a bed.
Sow your seeds, which soon sprout.
Then buds form and come out.
Wow, they're blooming. Hey presto! You've now a bed.

A brazen-faced hussy is stalking
The fellow with whom I am walking.
He doesn't object
To her bold disrespect—
It's the subject on which we are talking.

I must wake from this horrible dream!
I was caught in the aliens' beam;
I bubbled a cough
And my face melted off.
I'm astomatous, and I must scream.

Darlene, a cute female mechanic,
Has a body that drives the guys manic.
They imagine scant panty-wear
When she calls for more "antiwear,"
But on hearing "ball-bearing," they panic.

This tailoring school is a farce:
Haute couture that they're teaching? My arse!
Yes, they've sold us a pup;
We've been neatly stitched up.
I am cutting today's cutting class.

When I text her a joke that I know,
She bottomlessly lets herself go.
The response from my child
Lets me see she's gone wild:
ROTF & LMAO!!!

Like CDs, or your phones and TVs,
It's a standard — the whole world agrees:
Coax cables connected
And signals protected?
No-fuss, low-expense BNCs.

The fauces are found in your throat—
They're the tissues each side which denote
Where the food from your mouth
Must commence its trek south,
From whence hope of return is remote.

"As guns go," Tom confessed, "Yes, it's tiny."
(With his manhood besmirched, he got whiny.)
"Just lay off what I shoot.
I don't care. It looks cute.
You don't like it? Then go kiss my heinie!"

My nephew, who's still in his teens,
Wears a brush cut and tells me it means
That the corps where each male is
Hailed "Semper fidelis!"
Will welcome him soon (the Marines).

This fungus that's called devil's urn
Is shaped like a vase or a churn,
And its life-cycle tells
Those who search for morels
Information they're eager to learn.

Outdoor wedding plans?  All torn asunder,
When the rain poured amidst clapping thunder.
The wet bride looked bizarre,
Now twice soaked at the bar.
The groom fumed at the weatherman's blunder.

"We boarded a boat and we fled
From oppression", the boat people said.
Though their chances weren't good,
It was well understood:
They would rather be dead than be red.

"Monadnocks and geysers and chasms,"
The diluvialist posits, "show spasms
Of massive hydrology
Wreaked on geology,
Not drip-drip-dripping its plasms."

An insightful, terse definition
Of the deviant mental condition
To be faced by whoever
Pulled all this together
As seen in this verse exposition.

A cryptologic technician named John,
Toward  the life of a traitor was drawn.
His spy handlers he'd please
When he'd copy code keys,
And this top secret data pass on.

For charitableness you've been lauded,
Your generous giving applauded.
Though it's true you've helped millions,
Few know that your billions
Left countless investors defrauded.

"Grandma Nasty" just died and it sucks
That she left me her porcelain ducks.
Uncle Ned, it appears,
Now sheds crocodile tears.
He inherited six million bucks.

My sweet sister insists she finds bliss
Smooching spiders. This claim I dismiss,
And I'd gladly eviscerate
Any beast that's chelicerate,
And with mouthpart claws gives Sis a kiss.

Cornered Georgio can't get away.
He is trapped while the pianists play
Prolonged pieces today
By both Bach and Bizet,
With his bladder resenting delay.

To disintegrate might mean to dash
Into pieces, to crush, or to smash.
You can no longer see
What a thing used to be,
And now all that remains will be trash.

You stand before God and deny
He exists, and you laugh about why
He permits you to diss
Him with blasphemousness —
Well, you live till you die, then you fry.

Oh, don't throw your toys out your pram!
Yes, I treat all your emails as spam.
Hurt your feelings? Don't care;
I don't like you, so there!
Just accept that I don't give a damn!

Whatever you think are his charms,
Some things should be ringing alarms.
All the loot that he's got —
Does he pay? He does not.
He's deep pockets and very short arms.

Ten press-ups, then run on the spot.
Now some weights (if it isn't too hot).
Head outdoors (if not raining),
Complete circuit training:
Three beers, and say "Cheers!" — down the lot!

Aardwolves are wolves of the earth.
In their underground dens they give birth,
Sharing care for their young,
Slurping termites by tongue—
Like hyenas, without extra mirth.

Gorgeous Kate, a true Helen of Troy wolf,
Was betrothed of one Rufus, a boy wolf,
But he diddled with Dodie,
A willing coyote.
The result? Rufus Junior, a coywolf.

Derivativeness is quite sloppy.
No thoughts of my own; a near copy.
If I write of battalions
That guard Spanish galleons,
The original author gets stroppy.

The bunky board goes in your bed
'Neath the mattress, the sheets and the spread
Where the box spring might go,
And it forms a plateau
So you won't fall right through and drop dead.

In kitchens, where chefs often toil,
They prefer to see smudges and soil.
If cookware is spotless,
The water stays hotless—
Since pots that get washed never boil.

It's called bullbaiting, labelled as "sport,"
But a brutish and barbarous sort.
Chain a bull in a pen,
Set some dogs on it; then
What comes next is too vile to report.

Chondrogenesis: cartilage grows.
It produces your ears and your nose
(Where it channels each sneeze),
Cushions joints such as knees,
And some stuff that you'd never suppose.

Neither in his first youth, nor an old fish,
He's warm orange because he's a goldfish.
He attracts a young pike,
Who declares she would like
To embrace him — but, no! — he's a cold fish.

Breaks my heart how he's fallen; it's humbling:
Recent work seems distracted and fumbling.
His latest raw copy?
Disjointed and choppy.
Our publishing house may be crumbling.

"There's a gastropod, dead in my drink,"
Mrs Donoghue cried. "What a stink!
This is Stevenson's doing.
I've a claim and I'm suing.
Tell the courts that it's time to rethink."

I can bug you and meddle and pry,
Stick my nose in your business and spy.
If you tell me we're through
I'll encroach upon you,
But I'm otherwise not a bad guy.

Apostolic succession is how
Roman Catholics, and others, allow
For a 'touching' connection,
Through priestly selection,
Between the first Christians and now.

At Yellowstone Park last midwinter
They tracked the Siliceous Sprinter —
A geyserite thief
Who gave rangers great grief
By stealing that opaline sinter.

The cape buffalo's horns are quite wide:
He's eurycerous. Horns are his pride.
I won't leave it unsaid
That the breadth of his head
Is misleading. There's not much inside.

Capacitation's occurred, so my sperm
Are preparing to wriggle and squirm,
Then to enter her egg
And, as such, get a leg
Up on making the kid we'll name Herm.

Deposition of status, of rank:
You are facing it now, Major Frank.
Disgradation's the word.
You believe this absurd?
Lucky you, it was only a prank!

"You're in charge of the manor," I'm told,
"Learn our customaries well and you're gold.
They record how we've done things
For years—how we've run things.
Our past gives us norms to uphold."

An enchanting male dancer named Dantze
Had movements — well, just like a swan, say.
Some thought him a nancy,
His moves were so fancy,
Especially his artsy élancé.

List of elements? Here's 105.
It is dubnium, man-made—no jive—
In a Communist town
Of great physics renown.
It's produced, but it doesn't survive.

My young Luke has Her Majesty's ear.
See, he speaks and she bids him draw near.
Both have something to say;
Now he hastens away.
As you were. He's returned with a beer.

You're a prude and you say you can't stand
That my sexploits are notably grand,
Hotly sniffing, "This demon
Disseminates semen—
Spreads seedlets throughout the whole land!"

Meet two words who are much to my liking:
First, fulgurous: "highly-charged, spiking
Like lightning". Amended,
Makes fulgorous: "splendid".
One root; forking branches. How striking!

As my Thanksgiving gravy I'm mixing,
This thought comes to mind, though I'm nixing
Asking Dad—it sounds jerky:
"When I'm roasting a turkey,
There are fixings, but is there one fixing?"

To make crème caramel, you need cream,
And some sugar and milk help the team.
Take some sugar and heat it.
Make a custard and beat it.
Bake and flip it—it tastes like a dream!

Who first gave the caveman his club
And declared it was how he got grub?
Was the way he attacked
Incontestable fact,
Or some drunk anthropologist's flub?

They are normally found up your nose,
Quite a natural thing, I suppose.
We Brits like to pick 'em,
And secretly flick 'em
And stick 'em to all of our foes.

Coign of vantage? A very good spot
For a critic who thinks he is hot
And refuses to drudge,
To observe and to judge,
Like a voice from on high—though he's not.

In making a film, cast and crew
Get a call sheet designed to show who
Works each day on what scene,
When and where to convene...
How and why? Well, for that there's no clue.

Convection cells clearly convey
Nature's way on a hot summer's day,
'Cause that warm air first rises,
Then falls, then surprises:
A thunderstorm blows you away.

Extratropical regions are those
Where, in summer, the sun never shows
Itself right overhead,
And in winter, it's said 
That one probably ought to wear clothes. 

At first it was mainly taxation,
Without, of course, representation,
They resisted like hell.
In the end, they'd rebel,
And they'd issue their great  declaration.

My studies are backed philanthropically—
Watching plant cells respond chemotropically
To chemicals. They
Will grow towards or away
From the substance, observed microscopically.

Auto-Tune? That's a hymn to your car?
Or the way that you tune your guitar?
No! It makes your recording
Much better, affording
A shot at becoming a star.

Having given her harsh diagnosis,
With cod-liver oil Ma would dose us.
Guts flip-flopped, we retched
As we cursed and we kvetched
And we reeked of our fish halitosis.

Certain trees yield these oils aromatic,
Called balsam. My mother's emphatic
That one whiff of their scent
Makes her feel quite content,
While a dozen will leave her ecstatic.

I'll be needing a loan from my banker.
In my orange grove, now citrus canker
Turns each fruit into grunge,
Makes each leaf like a sponge;
This infection's a cause of great rancor.

Know that greenhorn who's new to the ranch?
He will do things that sure make me blanch.
The kid once turned his butt
To a bull during rut.
I found him draped over a branch!

The word fulsome meant "loaded", "profuse";
That was then, but the meaning got loose.
Now it's "odious", "vile".
"Fulsome praise"? Makes me smile —
Phony flattery fools the obtuse.

Consent is the thing that you need
If your cravings for sex you would feed.
With her "yes", jolly jape —
But without, why it's rape!
Yes, consent is the thing that you need.

As the train climbs the hill, something bugging
Us all is its painful, slow chugging.
As it rounds a big bend,
Nell yells, "Ha! There's no end
To the boxcars that choo-choo is lugging!"

"These badgers," my cousin was thinking,
While taking a pee after drinking,
"Are sniffing at me
Very curiously;
These badgers must think that I'm stinking!"

There are spots on the sun we can cite
That are dark, while some others are light.
Call the darker ones maculae,
The lighter ones faculae;
Hope they are "aculae" right!

Abdominal reflexes?  You
Have an uncle or grandfather who
Thinks you're still nine months old.
'Round your sides he'll grab hold,
Then dig in with both hands, "Gitchy-goo!!"

All internal reports at Ink Inc.
Say the firm is robust, in the pink.
Is this true? I'm not clear,
Since there's one thing I fear:
All external reports say we stink.

When awarded the Greeks' commendation,
Miltiades gave an oration,
"The invaders assailed,
But our army prevailed!"
And he railed against Persia: "Damnation!"

Navigation seems cryptic and hazy,
Made by programmers stupid or lazy.
The software's a beta,
An unfinished state; a
Consumer who'd buy this is crazy.

Ceylon jungle fowl females convey
A dull camouflage plumage display.
But the males? In my book,
It's a whole different look:
Like a rooster on steroids, I'd say.

It has flowers of purple or white;
From large green hairy leaves juices might
Be used as a lotion,
Or just as a potion.
Use comfrey. You'll soon  feel all right.

It's a town with a sweltering feel,
Called Kalemie (and once Albertville).
In the Congo on Lake
Tanganyika, you'll bake
As you fish with your rod and your reel.

This old boat ride's a fitting way back
'Cross the harbor. The town's white on black
Late at night from the ferry.
It's breathtaking—very,
My city—can't wait to unpack.

"Deep-sea  fishing," said Roy, "I'd enjoy.
Miles offshore,  high-tech gear I'd employ.
I would catch me a marlin,
Have it mounted."  "But darlin',
Our marriage that fish might destroy!"

Cacophonous sounds from your house
Are distressing my kids and my spouse.
My head's in a spin—
It's discordant, that din
You call music by Richard G. Strauss.

Jeff Conaway acted in Grease
And in Taxi.  He got his release
From this world.  His addiction
To drugs wasn't fiction,
And rehab fell through.  Rest in peace.

The room that I rent is a peach.
And the meals that we get? I love each!
I can't wait to have dinner,
Though soon I'd be thinner
If not for my boardinghouse reach.

Why we cry from our eyes?  Let's review:
Would tears from your ears be as blue?
Not the mouth nor the nose
Shows the sadness that flows.
When we weep, we've a rheum with a view.

See this steaming, scorched earth, this black void?
It was once a great wood we enjoyed,
Until one careless spark
Set alight some dry bark;
Within days the whole place was destroyed.

Hail, Bacchus! His goblet is ready.
It's filled to the brim.  Now I'll bet he
Will take many sips—he
Will get very tipsy.
(Gods of wine are so often unsteady.)

Just one vowel, one tiny false note'll
Turn bells into balls, just as crotal
(A jingle bell — round,
With a gay, jangling sound)
With one consonant turns into scrotal.

The PM's not really a cretin;
His thyroid's just fine—so I'm bettin'.
He needs to remodel
His cretinous twaddle;
He sounds like dementia has set in.

So el toro's completely controlled,
The matador's capework is bold.
With each twist and each pull,
It outwits the fierce bull;
What a caper! A sight to behold.

At ten months, I was saying "Agoo."
How precocious! I already knew
Of this Philippine town
Of substantial renown
As a spot merchant ships would pass through.

Bacteria's one of those terms
That tickles my brain till it squirms.
From the back of my mind
It emerges, defined
As a self-service diner for germs.

"We need flowers," said the soon-to-be groom,
"A small spray — on the day of my doom —
For the breast of each guest.
But what buttonhole's best?
They'll take budding; my bride, she'll abloom."

Mr Stanley, when starting your mission,
You must plan for a long expedition.
Doctor Livingstone's  lost,
Must be found at all cost.
Don't forget that's the Herald's position.

I fear that my : is swollen,
So my surgeon's cajolin', extollin'
A procedure to cut
Away half of my gut,
Which would leave but a mere ;.

In our blab school, the teacher spelled hen,
And then we would recite "H-E-N"
Many times, all out loud,
Little kids in a crowd.
This is how it was done way back when.

My husband can't see when I smirka
And mouth that I think he's a jerka.
It's not that he's blind,
But because he's confined
Me to wearing this face-hiding burqa.

My bipedalism helps me compete
For a role in the Nutcracker Suite.
I can dance with the best,
Unlike Missy-the-Pest
Who was born with two clumsy left feet.

The expressionist art of Max Beckmann
Showed life as a carnival—heck, man,
A circus of fools—
So the pigheaded rules
Of the Nazis condemned it as dreck, man.

The cosmist John Fiske once opined
On the way that the world is designed:
Not just theism's true—
Evolution is, too,
And its highest achievement? The mind.

Concurrency's tekkie talk for
Simultaneously processing more
Than just one application;
It gives us salvation
From simple batch systems of yore.

London streets sometimes meet willy-nilly,
Forming circles, not squares.  (Rather silly!)
Then who would lay claim
To have chosen the name
For one circus? He sure picked a dilly.

What's that? Do you hear what I hear?
A carol? Then Christmas is near.
But ere winter, I long
To be rid of the song
Of that one overpublicized deer.

An artist of eminent rank
Told his students, by way of a prank,
As they tried to decide
Why no ink was applied,
"Pay attention! I'm drawing a blank!"

"Honest folk? Scarce as hen's teeth," said Joe,
"And to find one, a long way you'll go.
Few and so far between,
In my lifetime I've seen
Only one: my son Johnny — the schmo!"

Only miscreants have the desire
To make flames of hostility higher.
Well, that's not my concern,
And so burn, baby, burn.
Now watch me add fuel to the fire.

Antonio ventured beyond
Friendship's usual charge to respond
To Bassanio's request,
For, at Shylock's behest,
He committed his flesh to a bond.

Big-eyed boatbills work swamps just at night,
For these herons do best in low light;
Their odd beaks (like flipped keels)
Aid in scooping rushed meals
(Frogs, snails, crayfish),  yet look a real fright.

In The Times there's an ad some old nob sticks:
"Have you heard my gold watch-on-its-fob's ticks?
(I've lost it.) If found,
I will pay half a pound
As reward.  Yes, by golly, ten bobsticks."

These trash heaps: a hideous sight.
Unqualified, base urban blight —
No excuses, no pity,
Can't censure the city —
It's airmailed from windows all night.

It was Tenzing and Hillary who
Confirmed Everest conquerable — two
Worthy men game to dare,
Just because it was there,
And an earthbound man's loftiest view.

I'm writing new orders today,
And billing for shipments — hooray!
The new orders I took
Exceed bills, so my book-
To-bill's greater than one, I can say.

When the cowboys get ready to wrangle
Those longhorns, their lassos may tangle.
They jangle their spurs,
And a tussle occurs;
At the roundup, they really embrangle.

Since atrament simply means "ink",
Could I use it for ink that is pink?
It's from Latin for "black".
Such enigmas will wrack
My poor brain, till it's painful to think.

Simple alkanes and alkenes are strings
Of carbons — plain linear things.
An "-ene" is no trouble:
One bond is a double,
And alkyne a triple bond brings.

"When the summer sun heats up my home
And it gets just too hot here in Rome,
I escape to Castel
Gandolfo, and dwell
There, away from St. Pete's heated dome."

At a concert a listener wants
Entertainment, at least for the nonce.
Though Borge could play
Classic music all day,
His was comical, par excellence.

How exoptile first had me frustrated!
A botanical term long outdated,
Here the seed germ's exposed
(As opposed to enclosed),
So to dicot it's clearly equated.

My poor venture-capital backers
Are out, each one, thousands of smackers.
Lost my restaurant when hoods
Broke in, coughed on the goods.
My system was brought down by hackers.

When a surgeon performs an ablation,
There's often a cutting sensation.
But ablated erasure
Of ice from a glacier
Means melting or vaporization.

TV Guide has the listings I use
To find programs that thrill and amuse;
So tonight I will scan it
For Animal Planet,
A show often broadcasting gnus.

For despots, well, anything goes.
They'll act as if nobody knows.
One strong absolutist
Is also a nudist:
This Emperor doesn't wear clothes.

The eleventh commandment I tout
Is the best one there is, without doubt.
You can harbour a yen
To ignore the first ten
But — Thou shalt not get caught or found out.

Might the wee folk imbibe and make merry
('Tis incurved, Lilliputian and hairy)
At the lip of this growth?
I declare, 'pon my oath,
'Tis a proper cup, apt for a fairy.

California's  no island, you'll grant:
Spanish maps called it Alta. Extant,
As the state's tourist gold,
Stand the missions of old;
And her flowers and forests enchant.

When my shoat's eating swill at his trough,
And it sticks in his throat, he will cough.
If he chokes on it, though,
It may cost me some dough—
That is tough enough. Man, I'm pissed off!

While snorkeling, sister Francine's
Gathered comb jellies. No jelly-been's
Ever swum in my ken.
But then, I'm only ten,
And ctenophores paddle with ctenes.

You're not dressed in a monotone, pure,
If your clothing is bicolor. Sure,
You have more than one tint
To your fabric or print,
So just hope that their dyes will endure.

On the net I am selling recorders,
So no state's overseeing my orders.
In effect, cyber traffic
Is a-geographic:
No countries, no limits, no borders.

On my street you can hear high heels click,
For the sidewalk (the pavement) runs thick.
It's a natural red,
Nothing added — it's said
That they built it of plain common brick.

The king's chamberlain, noble Ahishar,
Books Solomon's bedchamber:  Kishar,
Makeda, Na'amah,
Sweet Shulamit, Amah.
For the king's every tryst, he's the huisher.

So much depends, wrote the poet,
Upon a red ... barrow. (You know it?)
Readers held in suspense
Will rely, to make sense
Of the words, on the author to show it.

Was it Mona, you reckon, who chose
To look cryptic? Or do you suppose
Leonardo da Vinci
Just gave her a pinch? She
Perhaps had a Code id her doze?

I had problems that day.  In particular,
No way could I stay perpendicular
To our spacecraft in flight,
So I couldn't get right
My activities extravehicular.

Take some chicken, shallots (chop them fine),
Herbs and mushrooms, a dash of white wine.
Gently simmer and stir
To make chicken chasseur:
Gallus gallus of Gallic design.

My lawn is a major disgrace,
What with car parts in every spare space.
My home's ugly as sin,
With the roof caving in.
Scream my neighbors: "Please fix up your place!"

In China, I wooed Mary Woo
In her robe of celestial blue.
Such a long, breathless kiss!
And I hope that her bliss
Like my own, was celestial too.

I like it — it's dolce, my vita:
I relax with a sweet margarita,
As I feel my boat sway
And I while time away.
After all, you'll be back, says the Gita.

We moved in, feeling safe; things were good
Until bangers took over the 'hood.
Now they're pimping and dealing —
It's a harrowing feeling.
Friends say, "Arm yourselves." Maybe we should.

In polite conversation, it's true,
Certain topics and words are taboo.
Though your subject is cursable,
A curse, not conversable,
May inspire well-bred folks to pooh-pooh.

Something's wrong with his toe, doc — his right toe.
Take a cell sample, see if it's cyto-
pathologically foul...
Yes, I know he's an owl!
Do you not care two hoots for poor Tyto?

All last year, Johnson's pitching was hot.
As a batter, he homered a lot.
You would think effort pays,
But next season? No raise!
His deservingness didn't mean squat.

The baffling thing about guys
Is you never can tell by their eyes
If they offer romance
When they ask you to dance
Or it's lust that they thinly disguise.

What has happened to old-fashioned fairy tales?
Where's the grim in the Grimm brothers' scary tales?
Every Disneyfied story?
Appealing, not gory—
Let's bring back those bone-chilling, hairy tales!

"Lord, I've got the base crazies!" sobbed Zack,
"So stay off of the carpet. Get back!"
Shaking, shivering, he's
On his hands and his knees
As he searches for coke or for crack.

In Sri Lanka, the danio fish
Live in streams where they swim with a swish.
Here they live in aquaria—
They're big in this area.
I'll sell you a few, if you wish.

To this orchestra's fame others yield
In the popular light music field.
Of them all they are tops,
Yes, the great Boston Pops.
For one hundred plus years they've appealed.

I say, "Auntie, your mind's in confusion.
I must introduce disillusion.
The feds will not pay
To produce your new play."
Then she smacks me; I get a contusion.

My doggie was given a feast
By a bighearted butcher—a beast,
Since his generous present
Seemed much more unpleasant
When Rover keeled over, deceased.

My new system of signs alphabetic,
Is convenient and also esthetic.
For s, there's a sweater;
I've drawn every letter
As a picture. It's acrophonetic.

With fossorial feet, Mr. Mole
Makes destroying my garden his goal.
I'd installed wire mesh,
But his tunnels are fresh,
And his digging goes well, as a whole.

For polishing sculptures it's crude,
It's wrong, it's barbaric, that you'd
Grind them down with some rough wheel.
A soft, layered buff wheel
Makes mirrored my metal-made nude!

He tapeworm: "Let's get off the bleachers—
Our love life could use some new features."
She tapeworm: "You lummox,
We haven't the stomachs
For thrills. We're anenterous creatures."

Bea had dating and boys on her mind;
To do homework, she wasn't inclined.
When her grades fell to C,
We were certain she'd be
In a bind—she was dropping behind.

At corporate, they finally got smart.
The execs of this grocery mart
Allow scooters for just
The disabled.  You must,
If you're lazy or fat, push a cart.

At great cost you've contrived to allay
All our fears, so we ought to repay
You for making a stand
On behalf of us and
Your resulting expenses defray.

That life somehow once overcame
Surly bonds, and without taking aim
Crossed the void and arrived
Somewhere else and survived,
Is ballistic panspermia's claim.

I really must say, I'm appalled, Scott;
You're out in the sun, which is scald-hot.
Your chrome dome lacks hair,
So in summer take care
To use sunscreen to cover your bald spot.

The basenji is barkless, they say;
He doesn't say "bow-wow" or bay.
He just yodels instead
To get petted or fed.
Don't expect him to woof when you play.

A barkentine captain named Wright
Studied binary digits by night.
He was fooling around
When his boat ran aground.
Now his barque is much worse than his byte.

When the mad king did summon his knight,
The young horseman was filled with delight.
Making haste to his host,
He did fly from his post:
With alacriousness did he take flight.

"I'm so stiff," said the girl, so I told her,
"I am too. Let me help," feeling bolder.
Her belt gave me welts —
"What you felt ain't my delts.
The soreness is here in my shoulder!"

To kids, skipping class makes you cooler,
But St. Jude's has this nun called "The Schooler".
She'll take wood capped with brass
To the truants in class—
Absentation beat down with a ruler.

I came back from a run; I was beat,
And searching for something to eat.
When I finally found it,
I instantly downed it.
Whatever it was, it was sweet.

It's a humble apology Sid owes,
For he derogates orphans and widows.
Without shame he defames
And belittles old dames,
And disparages parentless kiddos.

Touchy-feely is how you connect;
You grab on and our parts intersect.
Your conjunctiveness means
That we're squeezed like sardines.
That's so cute, but my privacy's wrecked.

I once owned a mini dispatch box,
No bigger than, say, a large matchbox.
Couldn't fit long dispatches,
Plus lacked locks and catches —
Worked great as a cockroach egg hatch box.

Extra charges?  The airlines just ain't
Doing business with any restraint.
But your anger constrain;
Don't protest all your pain.
($50 to file a complaint.)

What applies to the dura is dural—
Or to duras—is that the right plural
For the membranes of gators
Or goats? Dura maters
Is employed by docs, urban and rural.

I grind out twenty limericks per day,
Whether tired or inspired, come what may,
Like a robot. I'm bored,
And I'm sure I'm ignored,
And the lousiest part is the pay.

She wore a translucent chemise
With a hemline just over her knees,
And I thought I might swoon
By the light of the moon
When it rose in response to the breeze.

A man with a bark may remark
That from bark he had fashioned his ark.
He'll embark (and not park)
Without sound, in the dark
If his poodles agree not to bark.

A broad bred so brutish a brood
That when faring abroad, seeking food,
They'll beleaguer a village,
Marauding for pillage,
Whenever her brood's in the mood.

Our eighth president, Martin Van Buren,
Had a lexicon he was secure in.
Chamber lye was a phrase
That he'd use in those days.
You and I, though, would call the stuff urine.

My mommy, she celebrates Festivus,
"The holiday that's for the rest of us."
So she sets up the pole,
Bares her soul to make whole
The grievances irking the best of us.

As a child, Alexander recalls,
He so liked to suck aniseed balls.
They were little and round
And a seed could be found
In the centre of sugary walls.

An adventurous buddy named Earl
Dreams of someday becoming a girl
Like a true Southern belle.
I advise, "What the hell.
Why not go for it? Give it a whirl!"

The wrymouth, or ghostfish, will swim
In the western Atlantic. It's slim
As an eel (seen fish sweeter!)
And almost a metre
In length, with a mouth that looks grim.

If you want to impress your girl, Frieda,
You can buy her a novel by Gide, a
New Lexus Sedan—
She's a jellyfish fan?
Win her praise with some sweet Acraspeda.

Effeminacy: womanish traits,
Signs revealed by some gays (versus straights):
Effete manner of walking
And grooming and talking
Which to nature, not nurture, relates.

In her job as comparison shopper
For Macy's, Maude once came a cropper:
The info she got
About prices did not
Include Gimbel's top mop. How improper!

A new pop-up has got me up upset:
Said, "Ms. Garr, it is you I will get!
Quite soon you will face me
With no way to trace me.
I'm on darknet — and coming, my pet."

I'm leery of smelling a rose
Lest aciculas stick in my nose.
These thorns will draw blood
That turns into a flood . . .
(That's as far as this limerick goes.)

Missed a party I would have enjoyed;
Shouted, "Grrr! I'm so cross and annoyed."
I said, "Grrr!" as a child,
But used words much less mild
When, grown up, I became unemployed.

Humble aglets, though often unsung,
Merit thankful acclaim from each tongue.
They hold laces together
In fair and foul weather;
Our shoes, consequently, stay strung.

He held a position unique,
And he came to our high school to speak.
His oration began:
"I'm the Navy's top man."
"Well, that's admirable," said I, pun in cheek.

From Louisa May Alcott (the writer):
He's a quirky conservative fighter.
They're four lovely spies
(In bikinis, you guys!)—
Lethal Women. The Right just got righter.

A voice is a face to the blind,
And I know hers: so soft and refined.
I'm so glad that she came,
But I can't place her name.
I've been struggling to call it to mind.

Altruistic, he never thinks twice
Of return — doing good will suffice.
We are grateful, but find
That he's over-inclined
To accompany gifts with advice.

We were drinking and having a ball,
When I found some relief 'gainst a wall.
Jack turned on a floodlight
As I peed rented Bud Lite;
That large, bright, broad light showed all all.

For the sake of this joke, let's assume
Jesus Christ, when he dressed in his room,
Put on drawers.  You might find
This amusing: what kind
Did he wear?  Answer: Fruit of Thy Womb.

Her boyfriend had promised to gift her
With something designed to uplift her.
She expected a tome
Or a song or a poem—
But that shape-shifting bra simply miffed her.

A banana is easily peeled—
Excoriable—swiftly unsealed,
Which reminds me of Jennie,
Who'd strip for a penny,
Charms candidly, proudly revealed.

Though Bush doesn't seem very brainy
(And his diction seems comically zany),
We're so glad he's not dead:
We'd inherit, instead,
His vice president ... what's-his-name ... Cheney.

We're working here 24/7
With ten-minute breaks—not eleven!
If only I'd known
How they moan on the phone!
Yes, this call centre's way short of heaven.

Why do I treat all your emails as spam?
